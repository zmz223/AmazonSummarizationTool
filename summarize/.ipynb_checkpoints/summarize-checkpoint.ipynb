      "0 It began as a way to make my car ride to college every day more  interesting. I decided I was going to stop listening to the same old music  on the radio every day, and instead start listening to audio books. This  way I could spend the 35 minute commute to school in a more positive,  educational way. Sadly, I found my school library's audio book section very  limited, but I was determined to choose on. After searching one caught my  eye. \"To see you again,\" by Betty Schimmel. It seemed interesting  enough, something to keep my attention, so I got it, and popped it in the  second I started home. To my surprise the book captured me like none had  ever before. Betty's words were so realistic, so straight to the point and  didn't cover anything up with fairy dust. It was about life and everything  involved in it. It wasn't just about the Holocaust, or the war, or the  horrors surrounding it. It wasn't about her experiences in the camps or  losing her friends and family. It was about life and how complicated it  really is. I'd find myself in my driveway, waiting for the right time to  turn it off. I'd be in the car laughin so hard my cheeks hurt, or crying so  hard my face stung. Every day as the story went on, I would come home and  share my experience of Betty Schimmel with my mom who was captured by it  just as I was. We even sat and listen to the last 45 minutes of it  together. I will never forget Betty as long as I live. For her story of  life, as simple as we all wish it could be, is in us all.\n",
      "1 Great price!  Super fast shipping!  Had trouble getting this to play nice with my wifi so it kept getting stuck registering with B&N initially.  Until I googled how to bypass that.  I ran it wifi free and leave it off so now now book suggestions or wifi battery drain.  Poppes a $12 Samsung sd card (32gb) in the side and side loaded the crap out of it.  I have 1400 books on here and I still have about 25gb free.  Uses Android chargers, fits in my side ABU pocket, battery lasts for DAYS, glowlight is amazing...we have a newborn.  I can keep the light off in the bedroom and just use the glowlight while I'm rocking her.  I found these here for $35 refurbished....such a steal.  Bought one for me and my baby sister.\n",
      "2 I am a loyal Nook user. When my Simple Touch would no longer hold a charge, I searched and found this one. It was new in original packaging. It is my favorite ebook reader for many reasons: external storage, not back lit, fast page refresh, many font options, sharp e-ink display. I especially like that my side loaded files are read and displayed exactly as I have them on the SD card with easy access. Nook has continued to 'screw the pooch' with their readers ever since this one. I don't know what I'll do when these are all extinct. My only complaint, therefore the loss of one star, is the price. I paid out of desperation! Maybe we'll all get lucky and Nook will get it right next time. Bahaha!\n",
      "3 This model Nook is the best available!  I read in the sunshine and there is no glare on the screen. I read in the dark while riding in the car and in the dark before I sleep. I love my Nook GlowLight. I put a removable memory card in the slot and carry my library with me in my purse all over the globe. I purchased and returned the GlowLight Plus. No memory card slot.  I purchased and returned the Nook HD. The screen was not readable in the sunshine. This is my third purchase of the population Nook GlowLight. Unfortunately I left my first one in the  seat pocket of an airplane. The second has developed spots on the screen where the light shines through as did the first one. The light breakthrough is annoying but I  can live with it because no other electronic reading device comes close to matching up with the Nook GlowLight.  The only reason I bought a new one is that I saw it on Amazon. I wanted to get one for my husband so I purchased two so we have an extra for \"just in case\". The screen white spot issue may be resolved with the GlowLight Plus but I am not willing to give up all the the advantages of the GlowLight in order to find out.\n",
      "4 This is my first reader, and I decided to go with the Nook after reading several reviews by people who had owned both Nooks and Kindles.  I didn't find reviews about the screen cracking until after my purchase, and then I got a little worried, but two things have eased my mind.  1) I keep it in the case, and it's fine, even though my cats occasionally walk on it. 2) On the back of my box, I found a little rectangle that said it includes a built in screen protector.\n",
      "5 Our local library is in the process of changing from the OverDrive library to the 3M Cloud Library.  The 3M Cloud Library will not support the Kindle format.  In order to continue checking out e-books, I had to buy a Nook.  This was a used 2 generation Nook.  I still like my Kindle better than the Nook, because the Kindle gives me the option to read horizontal or vertically.  The Nook does not offer this option.  The quality of reading is the same as the Kindle.  You can read the Nook in direct sun same as the Kindle.  The buttons on the sides of the Nook to turn pages are very stiff.  The swiping and tapping is another way to turn pages, but unlike the Kindle this requires 2 hands, one to hold the Nook and one to swipe or tap the screen.  Overall the Nook will do as a e-reader when the Kindle is not available.\n",
      "6 I bought this for my girlfriend who is a very avid reader, but also very...how should I put this...ummm.....frugal. Yeah, frugal! She told me some time ago that she couldn't see paying $10, or even $5, for a book at a store when she could pick them up at any yard sale for $.25! Even knowing how she felt I just had a feeling she would come to love the nook. I don't read all that much and I know I love it! So, I bought this nook and a $40 gift card to buy ebooks. Wrapped them all up and waited. When she unwrapped it she was very surprised, but also indifferent. She set it all up and within an hour she had purchased and began reading her first ebook. After having it for 3 days she had already read 4 books! She told me it was the best gift she'd ever gotten. I'm pretty sure she's already burned through that $40! The great news is that now when we go somewhere she doesn't have to choose which 2 books she wants to take. She has all of them in a smaller space than even one book! And the back-light is a well thought out and wonderfully designed upgrade! B&N you got this ebook reader thing down pat! I would recommend this to anyone who likes to read!\n",
      "7 It is a good reader.  I honestly bought it only because of the glowlight.  I converted some books to put on there, and I have some pdf documents that i put there also.  After a couple of weeks of using this, I found myself going back to my kindle keyboard.\n",
      "8 I gave this 3 stars because when it was working my wife loved it. But it developed the \"spot\" that so many others have experienced in glow mode. My wife loved the reader so she decided to live with it but a few weeks later it became totally useless when the screen became unreadable. We had no recourse through the seller but Barnes & Noble did replace it under warranty. Hopefully this one works without issue\n",
      "9 After nearly six years my first generation Nook finally gave out. It had been a steady and faithful (if slightly huge) companion and my first foray into the world of e-books. I tried using the Nook app for my Nexus 7 tablet but unlike the Kindle app, it was unwieldy and rather user-unfriendly. Not to mention needing the internet to actually READ the books I already bought. So I figured it was time to invest in another Nook--the Simple Touch.  No bells and whistles. Just a good, basic touchscreen e-reader with a very clear screen.  It's a fairly light little machine, weighs about the same as my Kindle. There are two aspects that makes Nook superior to Kindle: one is the expandable memory card slot. I've always liked the ability to add e-books from other vendors to my Nook. The second is the ability to customize screensavers.  Yes, it seems like such a minor thing, but I just like the personalization. I'm on Day Two of my new Nook and so far I like it.\n",
      "10 It Works, and powers up and loads!! I don't know what I'm going to do when I can't find my simple Nook any more. I'm light sensitive and am able to work only an hour on the computer, then I have a head ache! I think I would die if I couldn't have an E-reader that was not back lit. Not everyone wants a blue face when the are using any thing that is back lit. I know the market is small, but someone has to give us ill folks a break. I had 7 book cases full of my favorites and had to donate them to the Library because I couldn't hold them any more!\n",
      "11 We bought this for our 8 year old who has a great deal of trouble falling asleep at night. It has the perfect amount of reading light to allow him to read without waking his younger brother and it is so light! They have a great selection of books for his age range and though the battery says it will last a month I think t was anticipating only and hour of reading a day. I had to recharge today so it lasted 12 days with him reading almost 2 hours a day. Best gift we have bought him ever, hands down.\n",
      "12 I read a lot and the glowlight turns on after just holding the Nook button down for 2 seconds. So this is very easy to turn on in the dark. I chose this over Kindle due to being able to use epub's and pdf's. I like the new Kindle e-ink better but I must have epub. Nook is an excellent compromise and you have the added benefit of rooting it and installing the Kindle android app to read any kindle purchases anyway.\n",
      "13 I have been reluctant to get an electronic reader, but more and more books in our local library are only held in electronic form.  I chose the Nook because it has versatility in the formats it will handle and the GlowLight because I like to read at night.  Once I got it set up, I discovered how readable, portable and easy it was to use.  I can now take books from our library online, and that saves travel to and from the library\n",
      "14 I just received this reader after returning a gifted Kindle.  Nice screen and seems much more white than the Kindle Touch I returned.  I did root it to run Android, so it tends to lag in apps that it was never meant to run, but in reader apps, it's great.  It also has a micro SD slot (32GB works fine) which is the main reason I chose it.  That and the fact that it is so easily rooted, with a large support community.  I liked the Kindle's sleek looks more than the Nook, but the screen on this is definitely better for reading (can't speak for the new Kindle Paper White).  I haven't read outdoors with it yet, so no info there.  Now I have a ton of ebooks and, more importantly, all my college text books in PDF format.  In fact now that it's rooted, I can read any format file by getting an app (including the Kindle app!).  Web browsing is okay with Opera mobile.  Email is great.  Video is not possible, but eink offer a couple of months of battery life (even a few weeks would be great) which makes up for any shortfalls.  I leave my laptop home most days now.  Bottom line: It's the perfect addition to the modern student's toolkit (If you've got a little technical know-how).\n",
      "15 At first I was torn between the Nook Simple Touch and the Kindle Paperwhite. I chose the Nook because of price and the absence of ads while reading a book. I had though that the Nook did not have a good dictionary function, but learned otherwise after it's purchase. All one needs to define a word from the dictionary is to place their finger on the word for two seconds and then chose the Look Up option on the bottom menu displayed on the left.\n",
      "16 This started off great! I owned another nook that was more like a tablet and I was ready for one that read more like a book. The touch screen stopped working after a few months and couldn’t be repaired.  It’s just frozen on the home screen. I won’t be purchasing another nook. My next ereader will be a kindle.\n",
      "17 easy to set up and navigate. finding and loading books is simple. good readability. had some issues getting nook for android set up on my tablet so I can read a nook book at the same time as her, India will not allow the program, or B&N won't, not sure but it is a country compatibility issue. We was able to get Nook for web set up on my laptop though. To rush order it I signed up for the free PRIME trial, which of course allows access to all Kindle books.... I will see if cost of books on the Nook becomes an issue...\n",
      "18 Ereaders have come a long way.  I tried the 4th Gen Nook with Glowlight, but like the 3rd Gen much better, it has the navigation bottoms, as well as the dark gray casing that make the text stand out.  I also think that the fonts are even better on the 3rd Gen as well.  It was worth the wait to have a great ereader at a great price.  Will be reading a ton of books on this device.  Happy Camper!\n",
      "19 the reason ill take a eInk reader over a kindle eInk reader,  is because the nook has expandable memory (up to 32GB). when you get to the fire and nook color/tab its a different story. the simple touch is light weight and the battery life is amazing. if you just need an eReader with out browsing the web this is perfect. feels great in the hand, the screen size is just right and loading books are very easy. although if you can afford a simple touch with glow i would say get that one for the light.\n",
      "20 At the time, this was the ereader with the best touch screen, side page-turning buttons, a nice contoured design that made it easy to hold, etc.  I had this ereader for a couple years until I switched to the Kindle Paperwhite.  The Nook Glowlight was my first choice, but the backlight on the screen was super faulty.  I still shop at barnes and noble for all my paperback books rather than amazon, and like bookstores, but I'm no longer on the Nook train.\n",
      "21 So enjoy the Nook Simple Touch. Have had other Nooks but this is what I prefer.  I wanted an E reader that was just that...a reader.  I have an iPad, I have a smart phone,  I have a laptop.  I simply wanted an \"electronic book.\" Have laid my more current Nook aside & love using this one\n",
      "22 My son gave me my first Simple Touch in 2011 and I loved it.  Last year the battery wouldn't maintain a charge.  I tried to replace the battery but had additional issues.  I was so happy to find a market that still carried the 'old' reader!  It came earlier than I was expecting and was brand new, still in the sealed wrap!  If you are looking for just a book reader and not a notebook this is the one for you.  Barnes & Noble has a great selection of e-books and deals available.  The reader pages are just like a regular book and doesn't glare or fade in the sun.\n",
      "23 Really great e-reader with its touch screen and buttons. Sometimes I like to change the pages using the buttons. That was a big part of choosing the nook over the kindle.\n",
      "24 What I like about the Barnes & Noble Nook Simple E-book is  the Simple Touch feels like it was designed to stay out of your way. When you pick the Nook up, the first thing to grab your attention is the rubberized, carved-out backing that gives your fingers something to grab onto. The feeling's akin to folding a magazine back on itself. And despite the shorter body, the screen is the same 6-inch Pearl e-Ink display as the Kindle 3, so the text is plenty big, sharp and contrasty. Also, the Nook is light. It feels more or less like a small book. Even after an hour of reading, you'll hardly feel fatigued or bothered having this thing in your hand. Great for all ages! Definitely a must for someone who loves to read!\n",
      "25 I have been using the nook for around a month now and now, its like a Siamese twin. We are inseperable :) :). Okay, coming to the specs, the barnes and noble have thought of almost all features that are required by a reader. The inbuilt dictionary is a master stroke. One drawback is that, for PDFs, there is no option of looking up for using dictionary. The back light is very good and i am able to read for hours without any strain. In bright light, the nook is better than a book. I never expected so much clarity. A good buy. That too, the rate is so much less than a kobo, that has same features.\n",
      "26 Great value for my purpose to store and read PDF instructional files.  I use my Kindle for pleasure reading. Good Value and was shipped quickly ... could not find this model (basic) in the store.  Offers detachable micro sd storage chips and Kindle doesn't and that is the only reason I choose this product. I personally recommend the Kindle ... but this was a good value.\n",
      "27 I realise that B&N are getting rid of their own Nooks and are passing the baton to Samsung, so these older Nooks are being sold off very cheaply. I particularly like that it will take a uSD card on which I have many other e-books and pdf books, which can be read with the Nook. Apart from that, it works well, has a good screen, although probably without all the latest bells and whistles. I bought this to replace a very slow 1st generation e-book reader whose e-ink screen is not nearly as good as that on the Nook.\n",
      "28 So I purchased this item after my last ebook reader (Amazon with keyboard)broke in my bag.  So I was between this and the amazon touch and the only thing that swayed me to buy the nook was that I could find for cheaper online.  and I must say that I am very pleased with my purchase.  It is an excellent Ebook reader, I like the fact that it gives real page numbers (though at this point I am sure amazon's does as well).  But I also liked the fact that there are physical buttons in conjunction with a touch screen.  Overall, my reading experience with his device and Amazon is pretty much the same.  The two BIG differences is that the ebook store on amazon is WAY better than the ebook store on B&N (which is a big deal to me) and I like the fact that I can search content on WIFI with the Amazon reader (such as wikipedia).  But in terms of purely reading, there is no difference to me between the two.\n",
      "29 I love reading, and in a lot of cases I found myself leaving a book at home because I didn't want to carry any heavy things. This is great! I put in a small 512MB card and now it holds ~50 books! I gave it 4 stars only because the dictionary function isn't very good. I think it has a literal copy of a dictionary, which means it doesn't explain the word fully but still doesn't allow you to search for the meaning of a work in the translation window...\n",
      "30 I was a book purist before a month-long trip to Africa and I couldn't afford the weight of a dozen books.  Got this as a gift and it was awesome to bring along, I've used it ever since.  Super long battery life (one charge lasted the whole month, with reading for 20-30 minutes each night plus probably 9 hours on flights).  Also convenient to have any book available to me, I don't have to choose which one I want to bring on trips.  I will always love reading from real books but I can't pass up the convenience of this little guy, especially for traveling.\n",
      "31 I like it!  Been using one for about six months now.  Left it on the bus and lost it but was able to get all the books on it placed onto a new one thanks to Barnes and Noble.  Customer assistance was wonderful and patient.\n",
      "32 I like my Nook. No, I love it. I'm sure Kindle is good too but this was in my price range and can read PDF and epub. I've read so  much on this thing since I bought it and I can't stress enough how much I don't miss hardback books. Those things were heavy! I suppose if I wanted to look at lovely color illustrations I go back to my paper books but as far as I'm concerned, most of my reading is done on this now.\n",
      "33 This is our 3rd Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight.  I believe they are the best ereader.  I have not bought or read anything but ebooks since getting them.\n",
      "34 Just received my eBook Reader and am very pleased with it.  Only problem, the usb cable doesn't seem to keep a firm connection to the devise and it took longer than usual for the book to charge.  I finally used the usb cable that came with my first Nook and it charged in no time.\n",
      "35 I bought this to replace a Sony PRS-300 that I thought was too heavy and too slow in the page turning.  Yes, the nook is quicker on the page turning and lighter but I am having too much trouble to appreciate faster and lighter.  I am having an infinite amount of trouble getting library books onto the nook - I've yet to succeed and the problems lie with adobe digital editions.  Why aren't nooks plug and play?  That's my first big problem.  I have no problem with my Sony and the library book I wanted is now on my Sony.  The second is that I like to read while I'm eating my lunch - ereader in left hand and fork in right.  It is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating - the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side.  The Sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center, which is perfect placement.  I read the great reviews on the nook and for the price, I thought it was worth a try.  I'm also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general.  I don't need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they're all offering it now.  I also don't appreciate my registration info being used by B&N as permission to start emailing me crap - I am already unsubscribed from that 'service'.  I'm definitely not happy with the nook and I'm going to save up my money to buy another Sony.\n",
      "36 I love it! I love to read and was very resistant to the technology, till a friend gave me an old Nook. I took it on a trip to Europe and didn't have to drag two or three paperbacks along. It was great and so I bought a new Nook with Glow-light!  It s even better!\n",
      "37 Because the Nook Simple Touch runs Android (albeit with most signs of it covered up), it can be rooted to allow the installation of Android apps. Opera Mobile allows for web browsing; various RSS readers make keeping up with the news a cinch; Mango provides more manga than I can ever hope to read; you can even install Amazon's Kindle app for Android! There are limitations, of course. Rooting the Nook (via Nooter), while not difficult, does require some level of computer know-how. The Simple Touch does not have any sort of audio output, and the e-ink screen can't handle video.  Still, having near-instant access to news, weather, email, books, comics, and most websites makes the Nook Simple Touch a great little device, especially if you can find one used.\n",
      "38 I am very happy with the product purchased. I'm glad I decided not to buy a kindle. The nook have the opportunity to expand store for. Meets all my needs. It is a pity that there are limits to America and Canada. If it were possible to record payment cards in Europe would be easier to me to buy the book. After all, I'm very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "39 While it doesn't have a light and its screen has been far surpassed by other readers throughout the years. However since it uses android you can easily root it and install apps that allows you to read Kindle books and pretty much anything else your heart desires. Even can play Angry Birds if you really wanted to.\n",
      "40 I love this ereader. I used kindles sony readers - this one's got very fast and responsive screen, the brightest eink screen i've seen so far. The limitations though are terrible. So you'd better jailbreak the sucker, which i did. Now i've got Kindle app, FB2 reading app, opera, email apps. Bible Youversion offline app! It's just Awesome!\n",
      "41 This is the BEST nook, had all the top ratings, such as Consumer Reports- too bad they stopped this line at B & N. You have to buy it somewhere else, such as Amazon. Has the advantage of the side buttons so you can move the pages forward without having to reach with your hand and touch the screen, for example, when you are lying on your side holding the nook in your left hand, you can advance the pages using your left hand on the button, and not have to reach over with your right hand. You can't do that with the new Glowlight, apparently. Otherwise, the Glowlight works perfectly and is a real boon to anyone who wants to read in bed and leave the bedside light off. Otherwise, everything works the same. I enjoy having a dictionary handy so you can quickly look up interesting new words.\n",
      "42 I will start by saying that as far as an ereader goes, the NOok can't really be beat. You can use this just like a book outside in the sun. What I don't like about it is not about it as much as purchasing books from Barns and Noble. Seems like every book I get is list price. All I can do is download from B&N too, it's not like I can shop on Amazon which I do a lot. so, Nook is great Barnse and nobel is just OK, maybe less than OK in my book (that's a pun!)\n",
      "43 The NOOK e-book reader compares favourably with the KINDLE, as well as being cheaper.  Once you have mastered the idiosyncratic technique for converting books to EPUB format and loading them onto the NOOK - I suggest getting a copy of CALIBRE which will streamline the conversion process.  The NOOK is lighter and more convenient to carry around than the KINDLE - my wife crocheted a nice neat carry bag for mine.  I still have not mastered the bookmarking techniques (maybe I should read the instructions) but the NOOK has a convenient one or two click method of returning to where you were last.  TO sum up - I am very satisfied.\n",
      "44 I was very hesitant to buy a book reader because I really like holding my books.  I changed my mind when I bought a bigger bookcase and filled up immediately.  This Nook is great.  It is so much lighter than my IPad to read with.  I find that I use it a lot.\n",
      "45 Glad I splurged on this (which I never do). It is very light in weight, screen is crystal clear, very user interface friendly, and easy controls! The only problem I have run into is trying to have \"nook friends\"...I haven't figured out how to hook my library up with my friends' nooks...\n",
      "46 After using an iPad at night to read, and discovering it interferes with ability to sleep, I needed a non-backlit e-reader. This was inexpensive, and works like a charm. Recommended.\n",
      "47 This well-bound hardcover book is a medium brown color without the dust jacket, and has gold lettering on the spine.  There's also a lightly embossed picture of the front cover on the hardcover.\n",
      "48 After taking a Nexus 7 and an Ipad to the beach and failing to be able to read a book (dammit),  I bought the nook.  Using it in bright sunlight, and be able to read in the dark is Awesome!\n",
      "49 Bought this as a gift for my husband.  He didn't think he would use an e-reader.  The Nook is so easy to set up and use.  I have one too and we both read with them all the time.\n",
      "50 Loving my little nook. I used to read on my ipad but my nook is much better on my eyes since the main time I read is late at night in the dark.\n",
      "51 The Nook Simple Touch is a great E-reader for the price and the capabilities. I love how you can have a plethora of books at your disposal in one handheld. I like to read by the pool, in the house, or when traveling. I have not had much contact with the Kindle Paperwhite, but I will say after 3 years of having this device, it does its job and does it well. Plus, I love the functionality of the light for night reading. I do like a good paperback from time to time, but overall the NOOK is great. I also recommend getting a case (I did on Amazon as well) for some sort of protection and appeal.\n",
      "52 I downloaded this to have the \"real\" Kindle edition on my Kindle, though I had already downloaded Gutenberg's free version. (The Gutenberg version has a nice linked Table of Contents at the beginning that clicking \"menu\" and then \"go to\" and \"table of contents\" brings you to -- I'd rather have the easily accessible ToC. To get to the ToC for the Amazon download, you have to page back from the first story or page forward from the cover. It's odd that \"go to\" does not work for the official Kindle version but does for the Gutenberg mobi download.)\n",
      "53 I love it but unfortunately I already have a nick in the screen and the glow light shines through. I recommend buying a cover when you buy the nook.\n",
      "54 Love it, especially after hacking it to run Overdrive Media directly without using a PC! Free library books anywhere I have Wi-Fi. I looked into this before I bought it, and it's about an equal hassle to set up my home PC to download library books to the Nook as it is to just root the Nook and download books directly.\n",
      "55 A space saver. I have 100's of books and have ran out of space, so this will help me save space and still enjoy my books.\n",
      "56 I bought this as a gift and I thought you could download e books from anywhere but from what I being told you can only get books from the Barnes and Noble sight. The person I bought it for doesn't have internet so I thought they could download books when they had a WiFi connection and read them at home and not have to be stick just using one sight. Guess I'll try buying a kindle next time.\n",
      "57 Screen of the used Nook that I purchased, flickers a lot on each touch of the screen. It has been ever since I received it. Screen momentarily goes black. The whole screen flickers on each and every button that i\n",
      "58 The device physically, is relatively good for the money.  There are many reviews on YouTube and other places that address that point.  The problem with the B&N system is the fact that you must enter a 'default credit card' to be able to use or purchase any books.  If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.  Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.\n",
      "59 VICKIE IS AN ADVACATE READER AND THIS NOOK TOOK THAT PLA CE OFF ALL THE BOOKS SHE BUYS THAT ARE ALL OVER THE HOUSE.  COMPACT ENOUGH TO FIT IN HER PURSE, GREAT PRICE AND EVERY BOOK IS IN ONE PLACE.  PRICELESS.\n",
      "60 For years, I have used Android tablets as readers because of their versatility. However, their lousy battery life is a constant irritant. I bought this reader for my wife in 2013 and she's barely used it, so I confiscated it, bought a different cover, and loaded it with books and linked it to my library accounts through my Windows PC. The battery life is terrific, several days of nearly constant use and I almost never turn it off. The back lighting is sufficient, if not exceptional. The screen resolution and contrast is as good as most paperback books.\n",
      "61 I currently own this and NSTes without the glow light.  The Kindle - gets all of the rave - and maybe it deserves it  - but I am not convinced.  I recently bough a second generation Paperwhite - but do not even like the way it feels in my hand - so - I went looking for the NST with glow light.  What I love about the NST is its simplicity - all functions that I need are delivered with one - maybe two clicks -  I also love that it readily reads ePubs and PDFs and has an expandable memory slot - making it easy root - which I have done only so that I can get the Kindle app.  I have not had any luck with that so far.  So, if you have rooted this recently and have the Kindle app- please advise.\n",
      "62 So I really like eInk readers to read on.  We have tablets for pretty much every person in the family in multiple sizes... still, I prefer to read on a eInk reader.  I've owned a Kindle 2, and 3, & a Nook Classic, so this is my fourth eInk reader though I have had a grey scale reader, Libre Pro, which is similar in that it has no backlight but the contrast just doesn't compare.  Still even that is easier on the eyes for long length reading than the tablets.\n",
      "63 For the first year I loved my Nook with glowlight and would have given it 5 stars without a second thought. I bought the one with the memory slot and LOVE that feature. The glowlight and memory card slot are what sold me to buy the Nook and not any of the other E-readers. I fought getting an e-reader for years as I love the look and feel of a real book in my hands. My library also has e-books I can 'check' out without leaving my home. Another fantastic feature! And with book sharing from Barnes and Nobles... I couldn't fathom why anyone would want to buy any of the others. Still don't for that matter. The glowlight, if you are a big time reader and like to read in bed next to a sleeping spouse, is perfection. The light isn't intrusive and my husband is finally able to sleep right through the soft glow in the room as opposed to reading on my cell phone with that light. The battery also lasts me through an entire night, even with the glowlight on.\n",
      "64 The book is great.  Easily 5 stars, but the copy I received was not what I expected.  I read the book a few years ago and loved it.  One or Horowitz's best.  I ordered the book last week that is supposed to have been a library copy.  Well when I received it I was shocked at how small it is.  I worked at a library for 11 years and had never seen a hardcover as small as this.  It reminds of a Readers Digest condensed copy.  So instead of adding it my collection I will be donating it my local friends of the library organization.  So if you are looking to read a great Sherlock Holmes novel I highly recommend this.  But if you plan on buying a copy do a bit more research than I did and get one you will want to keep.\n",
      "65 E-readers are rampant throughout the book loving community. As I looked for an e-reader I found numerous devices I could’ve purchased such as the Amazon Kindle, Kobo Aura, Barnes and Noble Nook, and Apple iBooks. Many people today are switching to e-readers as modern technology advances. As I searched for an e-reader, I settled on the Barnes and Noble Nook. My first experience with a nook was the Nook First-Edition which I owned for three years. I only upgraded to a Nook Simple-Touch with Glowlight after an incredible Black Friday sale brought the new one down to thirty-five dollars, and I sold my original nook for fifty. I love my purchase and am glad I decided to purchase an e-reader from Barnes and Noble.\n",
      "66 I ordered a used BNRV350 that had 3-tiny cracks on the screen and 1 medium length on the screen. I paid a measly $26 +s/h for a grand total of $36. I also have a new BNRV350 coming my way in a couple of days and I may update the review. In my technology arsenal I have/had/used a BNRV300 (no glowlight version), Ipad 2, Galaxy Note 2, Galaxy Notepro 12.2 and Galaxy Note 8 tablet.\n",
      "67 I've been using ereaders since 2009 and have owned multiple Sony's from the PRS-550 up to the T-1 as well as Kindle 2, Keyboard and touch and an iPad.  All of these have their strong points but so far my favorite brand has been the Sony, even though you can't beat the Kindle for ease of buying books.  However, most of my book purchases are not through the Kindle site and I side load to the readers using Calibre software.\n",
      "68 Many moons ago I bought my first Ebook reader, it was a \"Rocket Book\"!  I must have read hundreds of books on that little device.  It was just about perfect.  Small and light enough (size of a paperback, weight of a hardback) that I could hold it one hand, easy thumb controls, had a backlight for nighttime reading, I could read the screen in daylight (most of the time) and it stored a bunch of books.  Heck, it even had a stylus for lookup and markup.  The day the battery no longer held a charge a small part of me died with it...\n",
      "69 Overall the nook glowlight performed well as a simple reader.  However there were a few issues that has convinced me to move to a kindle.  Unfortunately I have invested a few hundred dollars into e books through B&N so I will keep my account so that I can re-read them.\n",
      "70 I've had it for about a month now, and I have already devoured 2 books on it. This is perfect for reading at the pool (the main reason I wanted it). It is also great for reading at night. I have had not issues with it at all. I use the SD card to manage all of my books which is handy. I bought a nice leather case from B&N (definitely much higher quality that some of the others I have seen.) If you need something to use on the go and in the sun (very important because there is no glass screen to give glare from hell) this is the choice for you. Another main reason that I bought this one is that I really don't care about FB or YouTube... I have a Galaxy S 3 for that ;)\n",
      "71 I love this e reader! Should this break I will purchase another e reader from Barnes and Noble.  I have owned several of the nook e readers. I own the nook simple touch and nook color as well as the kindle keyboard.  I also  previously owned the original nook but  passed on to my sister when I received this one two years ago.  I have had none of the issues with the screen as other users but don't use the glowlight all that much except when traveling out of town.  All in all I like Barnes and Nobles e readers better than kindle and use my Nook the most. I find Barnes and Noble makes more solid and study e readers and tablets.  I mostly download free auio books from my local library and this works out well for me. A super e reader that does what it's supposed to and does it very well.\n",
      "72 I bought a nook about 6 months ago to replace my kindle that had broken (my fault, not a defect). I wanted it mainly because there was a light and I would not have to use an external light source because I like to read in bed. The nook is the perfect size, the light can be adjusted to your desired brightness, as well as the size of the words on the page. Setting the nook up and adding books to it is very easy. I owned an ipad before and I hated adding books to it because itunes is just a big pain. Like Amazon's kindle, you simple drag and drop your ebook or download via wifi from the actual e-reader. The one thing that the nook glowlight has over the kindle is the price, which is another reason I chose it over the kindle when getting a replacement.\n",
      "73 OK, so the Nook has a good readable screen, has a light for night reading, has WiFi, etc. Wow!!  What innovation, what a set of unique properties.  (Sarcasm off).  Yeah the physical aspects of the Nook are OK, as are most other readers.  What it does lack is any efficient way of organizing the books.  The software interface is incredibly awkward and clunky.  I thought the Sony inteface was bad, but at least you could manipulate books on the computer quickly and easily, and then sync that with the reader.  I don't need a device that is 1/2 oz lighter or a tenth of an inch thinner.  I need one which has a useful gui interface.\n",
      "74 I originally bought my wife a BeBook several years ago, mainly because of the format compatibility.  It eventually went to her mother, leaving my wife without an ebook.  I looked and looked and looked trying to find something comparable but could not find anything.  That was until I ran across the Nook Simple.  The Nook Simple had external storage, meaning I could expand it's storage with an sdcard, it was compatible with several of the formats that are popular and in use almost everywhere (epub, pdf, txt, etc.).  But the real deal maker was when I found the Nook Simple with the Glowlight option.  This is an amazing feature that provides just the right amount of light for you to read by, whether you are laying in bed at night, sitting in a car in the middle of the day and anywhere in between.  You can adjust the brightness from just a hint of light (good for reading late at night) up to somewhere close to a mini sun behind the text.\n",
      "75 Started out with a Nook Simple Touch, but my eyes aren't what they used to be so I gave that to my wife & got the Simple Touch with Glowlight 4 months ago.  I am 98% happy with it- it loses a point for occasionally going back to the screensaver when I press the Glowlight button, and one point for occasional ghosting in extremely bright sunlight.  Both complaints are trivial, as the Nook's good points far outweigh the bad.\n",
      "76 About a year ago, I bought this device after extensive research and reading of reviews.  This was going to be a replacement for my Sony Touch 600 that got broken and I was really interested in the glowlight technology.  B&N didn't have a store near me at the time, and I wanted to physically handle the Nook so I went to Best Buy.  I played around with it for over 30 minutes and fell in love.  I bought a case with a hard screen cover and once I got it home, loaded books, and blissed out for about a week.  If this is where the story ended, it would easily be a five-star review.\n",
      "77 This is the free Kindle edition of an assortment of Sherlock adventures.  It is an interesting read, and typical of his stories - you don't get all the facts until the tale is finished and the criminal caught.  I got this to try out the Kindle PC Reader software, and it works fine,so I will probably put one of the portable devices on my Christmas list.\n",
      "78 Only if you only want an ereader and don't want tablet functions to distract you while reading. I rooted mine to get bookstore variety and to read pdfs. Kicked up my reading. I'm Happy!!\n",
      "79 Hi - this is a free ebook I got for my kindle. You know in the event I ever actually used my kindle to read.\n",
      "80 I bought this e-reader right before my vacation to Punta Cana.  I was able to read using this on the beach, even with the bright sunlight glaring down.  The glowlight works awesome and you can even adjust the brightness.  The screen itself is a little bit sluggish, but this is because it's e-ink.  This is normal.  I'm glad I made this purchase and would buy again.\n",
      "81 I have had two previous generations of NOOKs before getting the NOOK Simple Touch with Glowlight (NSTGL) about three months ago.  I don't buy ebooks; I either check them out from the library or get free public domain books.  The NOOK is a great device for that.\n",

      "0 At its heart this book is about how one must make painful, uncertain decisions in painful, uncertain times -- and how one particular person and family lived with the impact of those decisions long after WWII had ended.  Reading about Betty's life, as well as her husband, Otto (not to mention  Richie), is a poignant, moving experience. All emerge as real people with  real virtues and real flaws -- products of the time and place in which they  were forced to grow up too quickly and in a world turned upside down. The  book works because of the well-crafted details: Betty's pre-war memories of  her mother's delicate tea cups and jam jars lined up neatly in a row; the  daily decisions her mother -- and others -- made during the war to protect  themselves or to escape the enemy; the description of how a friend, who  chose to pass as a gentile, was lost; and the pain in Otto's voice -- a man  who had resigned himself to always be second fiddle. No wonder he worked so  hard.  \"To See You Again\" reminds us that we're all too human,  that some choices stay with you forever, and that we can grow to accept and  even to embrace them.\n",
      "1 This book is very well written.  Heartwrenching story about love and survival\n",
      "2 This book came in the condition it was described as.  Really such an incredible story, highly recommend for anyone interested in reading about a first hand experience.  While the main character (the writer) comes off a bit snotty it is all of the other people (most notably her amazing mother) that bring such life to the story.\n",
      "3 This story broke my heart but Betty's life story is one of the best I've read. I cried as Betty, upon being freed from the camp,  tried on clothes donated by Americans and twirled around feeling pretty again.  No one except perhaps Betty's mother in this book is perfect but they are admirable, beautiful people who overcame adversity of the worst kind to live good lives. The man she married selfishly did something that I would have probably considered unforgiveable if I'd been her.  Betty is a good role model for women and I wanted so much to tell her so but she died before I could do so. Anyone who has suffered from being separated for decades from their soul mate will appreciate this story.\n",
      "4 I am a Hungarian woman, for me the book was unbelievable! I liked it very much, it was the most exciting holocaust book which I ever read. It was very personal. Thank you Betty!\n",
      "5 Oh my goodness. This story brings a lump to my throat and tears to my eyes. These people are wonderful. The story is true, heartbreaking and inspiring.\n",
      "6 I don't know how to exactly capture the impact of this book in a review.  It was impossible to put down.  It was both heartbreaking and heart warming.  She seemed like such an amazing strong person.  This book educated me.  It made me appreciate the ease of the life I have led.  Such a sweet love story in the middle of such horror.\n",
      "7 I found this true powerful love story a page-turner.  Betty was just a teenager when she fell in love with her schoolmate Richie.  Betty, her mother Ethel, her sister Rose and a brother Larry were in Hungry during the Nazi occupation.  Her father worked in the Underground aiding fellow Jews.\n",
      "8 An avid reader of historical fiction and non-fiction, especially pertaining to the Holocaust, I found Betty Schimmel's story to be a strong, engaging read. The story of her survival in a concentration camp as a teenager is nothing short of miraculous, as well as the way she rebuilt her life in the years following the war's end.\n",
      "9 Must read historical love story!  Whether you love or hate the characters, agree or disagree with their action and choices, it is a very compelling book that keeps you interested and involved in the story to the last page, and a critical documentation of life during WWII for many of those who never had the opportunity to tell their own story.  This story needs to live on as a testament to the power of human will, the strength of human love, the power of faith,  and the depths of evil that humanity can succumb to, so that we can learn from the past those things that are necessary for human relationships and those things which no human should ever have to experience again.  Yet these horrors are repeated in corners of the world,  sometimes with and sometimes without our knowledge.  We must always remember that we all have a little evil in us, and yet as humans we will always have more in common with one another than ways in which we differ.\n",
      "10 This is sad in a couple of ways. First, what happened to Betty, her family, and all of those affected by the Holocaust horrible. The psychological effects of their struggles are very evident in this novel. I appreciated her perspective, as there were a few new insights for me from that period in history.\n",
      "11 Betty Schimmel's book, \"To See You Again' is an important slice of history about love found and love lost in the midst of one of the worst tragedies of our time.\n",
      "12 When most people think of war or the Holocaust, they probably don't immediately realize the very unique, personal stories that play out against the backdrop of the larger conflict.  This book tells several such stories  from the point of view of a young woman who was lucky enough to survive the  worst kind of horror man can create.  The pages not only describe  interesting events from the Eastern European campaign of World War 2, but  they contain a love story that operates on many different levels.  People  of the present generation may find the story in its totality hard to  fathom, believe or empathize with, but the days lived by the author were  during a different time when life was simultaneously cheap and valuable.  Betty Schimmel is an incredible woman, and if her husband, Otto, wasn't  Jewish, I think he could qualify for Sainthood.  Buy this book.  You'll  learn something important while being deeply touched.\n",
      "13 I have to give this book 5 stars.  This story is one I will never forget; while the writing can be choppy at times the premise of Betty's story hooks you to the end.  Betty's love and memories of her first love sustained her through many of lifes events.  The fact that she was able to reconnect with him 30 years later is unbelievable.  This book I felt had an underlying message that war shatters lives.  Betty was fortunate to have those loving memories with her first love before the war and it is only natural for her to hold on to those when times were too difficult to take.  While I almost wanted to shake Otto at times for being so selfish I too understand his need to keep a family and the wife he has adored.  I hope that Richie Kovacs has found peace within his own life and has accepted his lose of Betty; again.  Really a sad, touching story.  I'm lending it out to many friends.\n",
      "14 I have read countless Holocaust memoirs but this book was EXCEPTIONALLY well written!  From the first sentence on page one Betty seems to \"take your hand\" and brings you completely into her life.  I  could NOT put this book down and felt I was at Betty's side every step of  the way!  Her unbelievable story tore at my heart, and by the end of the  book my emotions ran so high I simply cried and cried.  An ABSOULTE MUST  READ for anyone interested in the Holocaust (or anyone who needs a quick  reminder as to just how lucky we were not to have had to endure such hell  on earth).  I am convinced I will never read a more poignant (true) story  such as this one.  TEN STARS FOR THIS BOOK!\n",
      "15 I still have not finished reading this book and absolutely cannot put it down. Reading about Betty's great love, then losing it only to find it again during a horrific period in her life and in history, wartime Budapest, has kept me up at nights wanting to reach back into time and right all the wrongs she has suffered. Never, never, NEVER has a book been so well written. This book runs through all the emotions and I will never forget Betty Schimmel's story! A definite 10 star book if there ever was one.\n",
      "16 To See You Again is by far the best book, best Holocaust story, and the BEST love story I have ever read in my life. Betty Schimmel does a superb job of putting her memories in writing of all the horrendous things the Nazis did to her and her family. But then there is Richie, her one true love. This story will make you weep for them. Life is doing everything to keep them together, and yet working against them too. I thank you Betty, for giving me the opportunity to read your incredible history.\n",
      "17 This book was excellent! I would have never read this book if i didnt need an biography book for school. Im 15 years old and i loved it, I never knew what they went threw durign that time but i know a little now more then i did. I only wish that she found her true love when she lost him and married him instead of Otto. I wish they could have had the life they wanted with each other and had the love they had when they where my age. I wish all of the good luck with your life Betty and I hope the rest is with love. *~Ashley Gonxalez~*\n",
      "18 For anyone who has ever had a first love and lost it, this book is for you. It's a beautiful, heart-renching love story. I couldn't put it down. And keep the kleenex handy! This story will touch your heart.\n",
      "19 I have met Betty Schimmel and her husband Otto.  How anyone can say her story is fiction is beyond me.  Yes, both Betty and her husband Otto survived the concentration camps.  The deep emotions of her story are still evident in her voice and face.  This is a true life story about both the horrors of war and being a Jew in WWII Europe and of true love.\n",
      "20 I met Betty (one of the most attractive women I have ever seen) a few times and she told me to read the book.  I LOVED it, but you might need a couple boxes of Kleenex.  The book was great at mixing historical history/facts with her personal story.  It's an amazing book.  I'm so lucky to have met her and her husband.\n",
      "21 An amazing story of survival and undying love. The writing kept me interested throughout the entire book. I felt heartache for Betty and all that she went through.\n",
      "22 This story touched me in so many ways.  For anyone who has found someone they completely love, the thought of losing them is almost unimaginable...but was a part of the story of Betty Schimmel.  Overriding her entire narrative is the fact of how absolutely terrible the Holocaust was and how it affected millions of lives that might have been different had the holocaust never occurred.  This story will touch anyone who reads it and will make you realize how lucky you are.\n",
      "23 What an amazing true story.  Incredible, I could not believe how Betty's life has unfolded.  I truly great story to read and I highly recommend it.\n",
      "24 To See You Again is one of those rare books that actually keeps you hooked till the very last page. An unbelievable story of love and survival against extreme circumstances in Hungary. After reading the book I passed it on to my mother who had the same experiences of a book well worth it's 5 star rating.\n",
      "25 It blew me away that this is a true story. I kept thinking of a real young woman experiencing the euphoria of young love in romantic Budapest, her terror of the increasingly shocking Nazi atrocities, and her resulting  confusion and resentment. And what a humdinger of a climax -- true to boot!  This book is beautifully written -- straight from the heart. I couldn't put  it down.\n",
      "26 I normally would not be drawn to love stories, nor stories involving the holocaust.  However, this book was impossible to put down. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to get a better feel for what life  was like under Nazi rule, and to hear an amazing story of a love that never  died.\n",
      "27 Thank you, Betty, for sharing your story with the world and for showing us how love can sustain the human spirit in a time of hell on earth.  My heart went out to everyone in your life, and I only wanted your suffering to end.  A deeply moving love story.\n",
      "28 This book is so incredible because it is a true story.  It is amazing the hardships that Betty and her family went through.  Every detail the way the author describes each situation grabs all your emotions.  The ending will  shock you!  I highly recommend it!\n",
      "29 I love Lisa Tucker, so I was excited to find this book.  It was one of my favorites from her.  I like the way her books are so visual and engrossing.  They can easily be converted into movies.  I love the way the book developed the characters, so they each had a unique personality. I love the karmic nature of this book.  The evolution of the character of Matthew was something I really related to.  I would definitely recommend this book to both men and women who love books that really dive into the nature of human relationships and suffering.  This book won't let you down!\n",
      "30 This is the first book I've ever read by Lisa Tucker.  I didn't know what to expect when I started reading it but I have to say I have never read a more engaging book especially where the male protagonist was written by and so convincingly voiced by a female author.  Matthew Connelly is the 40 year old central figure and Ms. Tucker's depiction of his \"maleness\" is so right on that I found myself crushing on Matthew.  He is highly intelligent, fun, funny, sarcastic, charming, disarming and caring.  He manipulates his friends with a genius void of emotion for their own good as well as his.  As Ms. Tucker has written Matthew he is inherently clever and witty and humor naturally oozes out of his pores in even the most bizarre situation.  Through no desire of his own he inherits 10 year old Danny and 3 year old Isabelle (both homeless) and despite Matthew's protests he almost immediately bonds with them and the reader realizes Matthew's bark is just that and his bite is nonexistent.  One also realizes that despite his griping and fit throwing Matthew is always there for anyone who needs him.  Always.  The only fly in the ointment is Matthew's ex-gf, Amelia, who is a spoiled, self-righteous, sanctimonious, wealthy trust-fund goody-two-shoes.  Amelia hates big corporations, especially pharmaceutical companies.  When she lived with Matthew, Amelia relentlessly mocked and berated Matthew's employer, a big pharma company.  She refused to have lunch with him at his place of employment because she didn't want to degrade herself.  She is also what men would call a \"fatal attraction\".  She devotes her entire life to persecuting and stalking her now ex-boyfriend, Matthew.  Even when she is pregnant by and living with another man she relentlessly harasses poor Matthew and it's obvious to the reader Amelia is still in love with Matthew which makes her persecution of him that much sicker and dare I say it, \"evil\".  Amelia is truly one of the sickest, ugliest female literary characters ever.  Matthew deserved so much better than her and the other loser women he seemed to date.  How did such a nice guy end up with such creepy women?  Perhaps he has a little \"savior complex.\"  The Cure for Modern Life is an extremely well written novel.  There is a lot going on so one doesn't get bored.  When it starts to get a little bogged down in technical and pharma info it reintroduces the human element.  There's Matthew, Amelia, Ben, Danny, Isabelle, and the children's drug addict mother, Kim.  The story tells the truth about drug addiction but depicts the addicts humanity in a kind yet honest manner.  This book is now one of my favorites.  This is a funny, charming, heart warming, and even informative story.  I dare you to try and read it without crushing on Matthew.  Good luck with that!  :)\n",
      "31 With each book Lisa Tucker gets better and better. She's that rare author who  writes beautiful, original stories with deep and meaningful characters.\n",
      "32 The title definitely screams chick lit, but this book was much more deeply layered than I expected, and quite enjoyable.\n",
      "33 I really enjoyed this book. After reading several \"mommy-lit\" books with unlikable and seemingly mentally challenged protagonists, it was nice to finally read about one who while not perhaps a yummy mummy, had sense and wasn't a complete airhead. The book surprised my with its depth - I was expecting something along the lines of the foolishness I have previously read in this genre. The ideas of friendship, adultery and self-esteem coupled with motherhood provided a very rich story that painted a realistic portrait of the struggles in a relationship post-child.\n",
      "34 As a mother of twins, I felt a strong connection to the story's main character Amy. It's a blunt, funny story of a new mother caught in between the new world of diapers, spit-up, etc, her own insecurities about her life in general (she is unwed), and the transformation of herself as a result off all of these things. I loved this book. For anyone who is a mother, read it. It details the insecurities some women go through after having a child, along with the normal strains of a mother. But it also offers a refreshing and emotional outlook that anyone with children would understand about trying to understand yourself and accept the start of a new life and self. Can't recommend it enough.\n",
      "35 As always, I was captivated by the occupants of 224 Baker Street! Each story unique and well thought out, it makes for a literary delight. Even the narrator gets 5 stars for his part.\n",
      "36 I really enjoyed reading the original writings of Doyle.  The stories are very different than any of the Hollywood or English movies.\n",
      "37 It was with a little trepidation that I started this book, but as one who thoroughly enjoys Foyles War, I felt perhaps that Anthony Horowitz had the the writing chops to make a new Holmes novel work!\n",

      "0 I found this book in my local library a year or so ago, never heard of it before, skimmed through it, decided it was worth a read, then started as soon as I got home & couldn't put it down, so I went on Amazon.com and ordered my own copy. I recommend this book to everyone I know. Poor Betty--losing her father & distant relatives in the Holocaust, surviving it herself, losing Richie, marrying Otto, starting a new life in America, then finding out that Otto had known since 1950 that Richie was alive & had been searching for her. Hollywood should definitely make a movie of Betty's story, it's that intriguing. I was glad to see that she had some \"closure\" and found happiness with Otto. Betty & her son, Robert both died in 2010 (he was in a car accident).\n",
      "1 I had read it before, but it belonged to a friend and I wanted my own copy to share with my friends.  Will read it a gain sometime.\n",
      "2 I am a high-school student in Arizona. We had to read this book for school, and the Schimmels came to our class to talk about their experiences as Holocaust survivors.\n",
      "3 Not very many books make me cry..this one DID! Betty Schimmel is an amazing survivor and has a story that I will probably never forget. I do not understand how people can call her \"selfish\" or or say she complained too much. She endured and survived the most cruelest circumstances and her story tells how strong love can be even in the darkest times.  If someone can read this book and not feel any emotion something is wrong. This book makes you realize how lucky we are to enjoy freedom and health. I read this book more than a year ago and it still touches my life.\n",
      "4 I have just finished reading To See You Again.  It was the selection for my Woman's Book Group this month.  How all of the people writing reviews for this book report it to be \"wonderfully written\" is just beyond me.  A page turner?  Far from it.  Many nights I opted to watch television, which, as a avid reader I never do, because the book did not entice me enough to wish to bunker down to finish it.  If I didn't know better I would have said this book was written by a junior high school student!  The writing is as horrific as the story Betty has to tell.  If one were to do an analysis on the grade level it is written on I am sure it would fall in the single digits.  Betty often repeats herself and any writer who uses the descriptive \"great\" as often as Ms. Schmimmel does in her book needs to study the written art form more thoroughly.\n",
      "5 I have never ever read a book that touched my life like this one, I read this over 12 months ago now and it still has a place in my heart, I wanted the end to be different but  I could understand why she did what she did, loved it that much, I am going to visit the area, to anyone thinking about reading this, don't think no more, it is the best book you'll ever read.\n",
      "6 I found this book on a shelf at home, and had no idea where it had come from. It's possibly a loaner from a family member or friend--but since I've been sheltering-in-place due to COVID-19, I'm reading voraciously these days, and decided to give it a spin. I'm a little sorry I read it all the way through, because from the start I found most of the characters lacking in dimension and credibility. The two children, Danny and Isabelle, are at least sympathetic; the adults, on the other hand, seem predictable and, at times, cliched. Character development takes a back seat to the overburdened and unlikely plot--Matthew, the vice president of a huge pharmaceutical company, takes in two nearly-homeless children because their addict mother is incapable of keeping them safe. He pays for a sitter to care for them in his edgy inner-city loft apartment when he's gone, which is frequently. He sends their mother to an expensive rehab program in Florida after Danny begs him to. Later he learns that the children's mother is dying of AIDS, and they will soon become wards of the court. Meanwhile, Matthew's former live-in girlfriend, Amelia, who is now married to Ben, his best friend from medical school, struggles to come to terms with her alternating feelings of love and hate for Matthew. Amelia becomes pregnant only to discover that Ben has never wanted to have children; his passion is--and will always be--science, research, saving lives. There seems to be a lot of sturm und drang in these characters' lives, emotional dishonesty and/or lack of genuine communication. Although there are hints throughout the story that Matthew and Amelia may ultimately reunite, the manner in which the stars realign so that Danny and Isabelle can become members of their new family together strains credulity. Ultimately, I found that I really didn't believe enough in any of the characters to care about their futures.\n",
      "7 I bought this book for my Mother. She  has just finished reading it, and thought it was wonderful. It was hard to put down, as it was so enjoyable, she didn't want it to end. Can't wait to read it myself.\n",
      "8 I've never written an Amazon review before... but this book was so AWFUL I felt had to warn others before they bought it or wasted time reading it. I read a lot, and certain themes tend to reappear in books, certain classic personas emerge in the disguise of new  characters, certain familiar plot lines are found interwoven in many stories but with interesting new twists & turns. Usually there is some originality in how these things are accomplished.\n",
      "9 My first book review since high school - oh, boy! Before I start though, I have to ask why so many of these reviews do nothing else but give a synopsis of the plot line? Isn't that already done above? And what's the point of giving the story away before people read the book? Just say what's good or bad and that's it\n",
      "10 This book/each character touched my heart in so many ways. It kept my attention all the way through. I didn't want this story to stop though it had the perfect ending to the cure for modern life. We all know what to do but spend more time complicating our lives and blindly following the darkness of our minds.\n",
      "11 I loved reading this book; it brought back memories of books I used to read when I was a child, in which you could choose the fate of the characters, or rather, be part of the story. Just like another reviewer wrote; \"is not Proust\" or anything similar but is great escapism. I read it all on a rainy afternoon and although I'm not in my teens, I could identified with the frustration Cathy's felt dealing with her evasive boyfriend, her know-it-all best friend and her (not at all) available mother. I just can't wait to read the sequel (is waiting patiently by my nightstand table).\n",
      "12 I first read this book in middle school. I’m glad I find it years later here on Amazon. It came with all the packages of clues too!\n",
      "13 The seller is very good and the book was new. I didn't like the history thought, but everybody has their own opinion, read and discover for yourself what you think.\n",
      "14 I was really upset about this paperback book. I did not realize it did not actually have the evidence outside of the book. It's just on the book and it does not make me want to actually investigate. I read this book in middle school and was intrigued by all the things you can touch and hold and was so disappointed in what I received.\n",
      "15 I had not known that this was a book designed for teen readers.  However, it held my interest, somewhat, and I finished reading it.\n",
      "16 Bought this for my wife she was super excited at first and then found every reason not to finish it. Maybe not the best gift but as a husband it can gets hard to surprise someone you spend so much time with. I have looked through the book a few times myself but have never felt compelled to investigate it and sadly it just sits on the shelf.\n",
      "17 This book was given to my 11 year old daughter.  I figured there would be clues in the book that might escape a girl that age so I planned to read with her for bit to help her get a start on solving the mystery.  But, lo and behold, 180 pages later she AND I finished the book together.\n",
      "18 When I got this in the mail, I was so excited. I'd heard a lot about these books and couldn't wait to read it. From the first page, I was hooked. But, unfortunately, as the book continued, it slowly began losing its appeal.\n",
      "19 I remember shopping with my friends and saw this in Walden Books. Sorry to say, but I'm more into the cover than the content when I look for books to read, I like surprises. When I looked through it, it just astounded me, it kind of reminded me of the journal I'm creating myself, so I bought it. At first, it seemed kind of interesting with the sketches and different fonts. How unique it was to show a flashback by using a computer address-something like that. Although, it does seem boring in some areas, but over all it was very good. I actually like the whole idea of calling numbers and looking through the evidence, being a detective is fun! The end surprised me, I never knew it would end like that, the more surprising the better. I think they should make more books like this out there.\n",
      "20 To tell you the truth. i only bought this book cause the \"evidence\" in the inside. But as i started to read it. i was bored.. i got to about 6 pages. and i was like great i bought this book for NOTHING! Then one day i actually picked it up and started reading it. FORREAL this time. Once i started i couldnt stop. It was like i was taken by an ocean wave that only compelled me to read. It took me about 2 days to fully finish it. The characters are GREAT and fun to follow. and some of the choices cathy makes will only keep you guessing, and making you want to read more. It had VIVID writing towards the end. and i would DEFFINATLY recommend it.\n",
      "21 I love how in the inside cover of the book there's a package of little information about the girl and her family, and random drawings. I also love the random drawings inside the book on every page. This book is really interesting and it really intrigues me by the way the author writes, explaining every detail of what the main character, Cathy, is doing with the boy.. Yes. It gets that “weird”. As a 16 year old high school student that does not really enjoy reading books, I definitely will be reading more books from this author, better than eating pasta!\n",
      "22 I love how in the inside cover of the book theres a package of little information about the girl and her family, and random drawings. I also love the random drawings inside the book on every page. This book is really interesting and it really intrigues me by the way the author writes. As a 16 year old high school student that does not really enjoy reading books, I definitely will be reading more books from this author. :D\n",
      "23 I read it before and loved it but now I want to buy a copy. I haven't bought it yet but if I do, the hardcover version, does it have the black cover or would it be the one that's blue with the drawing of Cathy on it?\n",
      "24 This book was.... Wow. I've read a lot of books since I read this one, but this is still my favorite. The ending is definitely impossible to predict.\n",
      "25 I love this book! It's not like anything I have read before. With actual messages to listen to and web sites to visit, this is by far the most interactive book I've ever read. It's like solving a real mystery. I haven't been able to put it down since I got it.\n",
      "26 I read this book in one day.  Although I may be a little older than the demographic this book was shooting for, I still enojoyed it.  A friend turned me onto this book and then I turned another friend onto it.  It was a fun and interesting story and the \"evidence\" included with the book is great!  It's a great way to get someone into the book and feel really included with the story.  I would recommend this book to many friends.\n",
      "27 As a fan of Nick Bantock's imaginative interactive books (i.e. Griffon and Sabine) I was sure Cathy's book would be equally interesting and a perfect gift for a young teen.  However, the book description did not prepare me for the drug references and images in the book.  If I knew these were in there, I would not have bought the book.  I returned it immediately!\n",
      "28 To start with, I have to say when I saw this book at the store, I knew it was not worth buyin (because it is import the price was really high) but I was interested. Anyways, my friend lend it to me few weeks ago, and I read it. The story is quite boring, but readable, however the set up, little notes on the book, the little things that come along with it make it more attractive. I don't recommend you buy it and I certainly recommend you read something more interesting. However, if you already own it you may as well read. (Plus, it can be a great gift for teenage girls.)\n",
      "29 I used to have this book in high school and someone stole it so I bought it again as an adult because I loved it that much!\n",
      "30 Research for a project I'm doing. No longer a live trail as such but I'm sure teenagers would love following fthem clues\n",
      "31 Love my Nook! Still a newbie with it, but have been using e-reader device for years!! Its like having a novel in your hands, again (just now an e-book) Will always be a hardbacks/paperback lady & love reading novels as e-books.... Especially when I am traveling over an 8 hours car trips & taking a flight !!\n",
      "32 Got this for my girlfriend's birthday. She loves to read. The drawback is that she has books all over the place.A friend told me baout this product. this product is right up her alley, she can read as many book as she wants and keep it in he virtual libruary. Unforutnately, the product is too good! She is always glued to the Nook and theres is less time for poor ole me. For this, you get only four stars! i guess i can get a hobby now! Thanks a lot! hope you will engineer some goodd flaws on the next generation.\n",
      "33 I must admit I was a skeptic regarding ebooks. I thought nothing could beat a good ole paperback in my hand. after purchasing 2 of these for my wife and I on a whim I have to admit, I love it.\n",
      "34 I carry this with me everywhere. It lasts FOREVER. The battery literally lasts a month. I use it to read fanfiction primarily and upload all of my stories. Just a warning, unless you root the device it's basically useless. It would not let me put any fanfiction I downloaded on it until I rooted it. Even now, I can see the cover photos but no descriptions because it was designed to only read B&N books. I found ways around this by just clicking on the book and having the summary the main page, but it's still annoying.\n",
      "35 I had to give a gift to a family friend of mine who has very badly deformed hands (due to arthritis and surgeries) which makes holding a book hard for her. I knew she was an avid reader when she had better hands.\n",
      "36 and she was a very happy lady when she opened this for Mothers Day. These are an amazing examples of modern technology ( I have one myself.......to me. I'm 64 years young and things like this still amaze me. Purchase a book over the internet, turn this device on, carry it anywhere within range of a WiFi signal and the book is automatically downloaded into it. Nothing more to do. Just read your new book. Oh....did I mention that I live in Panama?\n",
      "37 I love it for reading, but it takes forever to turn it on where you can get back to the place you left off reading.  Somewhere on it there are supposed to be \"bookmarks\" to use, but I only saw them listed once and can't seem to get back to them.  I've only used it for about 2 weeks so I will get used to it soon.\n",
      "38 After purchasing a reader prior, another family member wanted one. But they wanted just a reader. There is no better reader as the pages are crisp and so similar to paper. I held off for the longest time because I thought I had to have to feel of the cover and the pages. Once you read on a reader, you will be hooked.\n",
      "39 I got a Nook from my husband for Christmas and I love it so much that I am shopping here to get one for him and another one for my brother who is an avid reader but who is pretty much stuck at home for health reasons. It's a perfect gift for those who find it difficult to get to stores or libraries to choose books. At [...] all the books are FREE and include most of the classics. They download in a flash and so do books from my library. Even the barnes and Noble website has good deals on books under 2.99.\n",
      "40 My wife have the older version of this Nick that was not backlit. She she told me she wanted this one and totally loves it. Now she's about to break me buying books all the time but it is well worth it. It's all so much cheaper than buying it in the stores anywhere. Great product.\n",
      "41 This was a gift to my son who often reads in the dark. He uses it often\n",
      "42 I absolutely love this little thing. I now have a lot of books and enjoy reading a couple of hours before going to bed. I have considered jailbreaking it, but as for now I'm happy with the default options.\n",
      "43 I couldn't live with out this. I take it everywhere. And am super excited to take it to Florida when I live there for 8 months. I recommend this product to people who don't have the time to lug big books with them every where they go and need something to do on a flight or while waiting for anything.  I hope this helped.\n",
      "44 I bought this book sometime ago. I love reading and this book really caught my eye but I just couldn't get into. It was just boring.\n",
      "45 I purchased this for my Mom after much discussion.  She loves to read actual books.  I think it is the thought of holding them.  Now that she has her Nook she can't believe she didn't want one sooner!\n",
      "46 Classic and must read for everyone!  Sherlock Holmes has grown in popularity recently.  With the tv shows and movies.  I highly recommend reading the book.  I don't like to write too much in book reviews because I feel that in order to adequately write a review, I would have to give away information that would be key to plot. I don't like to be the person to give away spoilers. Therefore my book reviews are always very short and only say a few things in order to tell you, book reviews are much to subjective and I never read a book review before I read a book. I read a book based on what the book is about which I don't read a review to get. If you want more information, buy the book and read it. :)\n",
      "47 This book made me laugh, made me cry & occupied my pregnant brain while escaping my toddler in the bath....Easy on \"The Mommy Brain\" entertaining reading... if you are considering that type of book then I would highly recomend Yummy Mummy!\n",
      "48 I picked up this book at a discount store and fell in love right away! I am not in to romance novels, so this was a nice break from the fluff or horror that is written for women today. More books about being a Yummy Mummy would be wonderful!\n",
      "49 I bought is for my sis in law for her birthday and she really enjoys it. she's only had it a couple days and has already downloaded so many books.\n",
      "50 I already have the same book from a previous purchase, but when I discovered this version had copies of the original artwork that went into the magazines where Sherlock Holmes was serially published, I just had to get it. It was well worth it. A simple \"double click\" blows up the picture on my screen. It makes me feel like I'm actually part of what the original readers experienced...the only difference is I already know how the stories end. I love the artwork. It brings an additional dimension to the works.\n",
      "51 Teaching short stories to my 9th grade ELA students.  It's perfect!  We finish a story before they have time to get bored.\n",
      "52 I confess to going on a reading binge of Sherlock stories after watching the BBC show Sherlock. Though I read some of them many years ago as a young girl, I never truly appreciated the brilliance until I went back and read them all.\n",
      "53 I never thought I would want to give up my tangible books for an eBook but I have really enjoyed having the book although I still break down and buy a hardcover now and then for my library.  I feel good about saving our landfills.\n",
      "54 You just gotta love Sherlock! It's been many years since I've read this book, so I decided to read it again. It is just as good the second time.\n",
      "55 I read all the spec and review first before I buy it, and when i got the reader its just as i expected. I love it so far\n",
      "56 I JUST finished reading The House of Silk, & even though I don’t write reviews very often, felt I really wanted to do so in this case. This is a GREAT book! Not just an ok book, or even a good book, but really a GREAT, WONDERFUL book! I don’t believe in giving away the plot, or warning about “spoiler alert,” but I will say that the plot moves very quickly, & keeps your interest from the beginning. I suppose you have to be expecting a Sherlock Holmes mystery, as there is a certain style, which is unique (or, I should say, almost unique, because I think Mr. Horowitz has duplicated Sir Conan Doyal as much as could be done,) & if you don’t like that, the kind of language used, the historic setting, etc., then it may not be enjoyable for you. The House of Silk is intellectually challenging, in a way.  It’s got many unexpected  twists & turns. There is a dark side to it, which may upset some of a sensitive nature. I didn’t like that part, but accepted it as part of what made the book what it was.\n",
      "57 I bought the nook for my self, but my husband took it over. He studies his bible with it. I could never have bought a better gift for him\n",
      "58 There's a reason this book is so enduring. I taught it to my high school classroom twice and read through it on my kindle again recently. Sherlock's adventures and Watson's observations never get old!\n",
      "59 I alway spend a week each year reading Conan Doyle's works. This last week I reread stories I know well but time and time again I go back and get involved. This time, I read the stories to help me think out my next novels plot where a detective solves a current crime.\n",
      "60 I love this nook.  I know that my mom will love to read for a long time.  She will be surprised on Mother's Day.\n",
      "61 This is probably exactly how Dr Watson would have written it, yet I wish it was a little quicker to pick-up the pace. It took almost halfway thru to get into the book and the theme is a tough one.\n",
      "62 The best birthday present I ever got.  Can't count how many books I read on this thing.\n",

      "0 I love my Nook Simple Touch with Glow Light.  I'm an avid reader, often reading in bed.  My husband would complain that the light was preventing him from going to sleep.  I can now read until my heart is content and my husband doesn't complain about it.  I take it with me on international trips and can read without disturbing my seat mate with the overhead light.\n",
      "1 I've used a nook simple touch for a long time now, at least a year, and I've always loved it but hated that I had to have a light on to read at night (this isn't the stone age, we have the technology) so I got myself the simple touch with glowlight for christmas and I LOVE it highly recommend it to any avid readers out there!\n",
      "2 I am very pleased with my Nook.  I bought it primarily for downloading from the library.  It does this without any problems whatsoever.  The print quality is excellent and it is so easy to use.  Also it has a long battery life and a very fast charging response.  I have taken the extended warranty as I felt it was a very reasonable price.  I previously owned a Kobo and would never buy another.\n",
      "3 So glad the Nook Simple Touch with Glow Light was available.  I love how you can page thru books with this device.  Works great!\n",
      "4 The GlowLight Nook Simple Touch was a gift for my husband who has severe arthritis but loves to read. Having this reader enables him to read without pain from holding a book. He reads for two to six hours a day. Every time he has some spare time he's on his Nook. Thank you for enabling him to continue to enjoy this pass time. As a retired senior with a computer the Nook Simple Touch GlowLight provides just enough technology without duplicating processes.\n",
      "5 I'm the kind of guy that wants something to function well and that's it.  This thing is brilliant at what it does: displays ebooks.  No frills, no apps, no video, no nonsense.  Because of this it makes it very easy to use.  Download Calibre for free and this baby syncs right up with it.  Battery lasts forever, and it has the same charger as most android smart phones, so In the mornings I take my smartphone off its charger and replace it with my little nook.  I am in the military and as someone else said, this fits perfect in the side cargo pocket of my ABU's.  I had the Kobo, which was a great reader, and my wife had the last nook which I didn't like because it was so damn heavy.  I bought this for me so I could give my Kobo to my little girl.  I was able to snag one used on here from a seller named NikonLover for $47!  This thing is really great.  The only complaint I can make is that the page buttons are a little too recessed, but this is not a huge issue as I turn the pages mostly via touchscreen anyways.  Using this little beauty, and loading all of my own books, and PDF's that I have converted via Calibre, makes me beg the question: Why are people still buying Kindles?  I guess that is the same dilemma I have with Iphones.  Oh well, a fool and his money....  Buy this now!  You will not regret it!\n",
      "6 I have had this a few days and I love it! It arrived earlier than expected which is a plus! I have never had a nook before so I'm unsure whether my problem is an issue with my nook or all nooks but the power/sleep button on the back is loose feeling and is hard to press. Other than that, I have barely put this thing down since it arrived (: good thing I'm on winter break from school!\n",
      "7 A christmas gift for my husband. No time for the library so this is a perfect product for him. He loves the light and the size. It is very convenient. I would recommend this for any avid reader! I would recommend a Pro Tek case to keep it safe.\n",
      "8 I am so in love with my nook, the best feature ever is the light that lets me keep the overhead lights off, my husband sleeps better now to, the room is dark but my book is light, just perfect\n",
      "9 I bought myself the Nook Simple Touch ebook reader for Christmas and I'm so pleased that I did.  This model doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the others Nooks but, in my opinion, you don't need them.\n",
      "10 I love this NOOK. I can read in the dark now and that makes my hubbie happy. I recommend the insurance though. I have a star in my screen already because I carry it everywhere with me\n",
      "11 My NOOK Simple Touch was quickly delivered and is everything I wanted it to be. I especially love the GlowLight that it has, makes reading at bedtime so much easier!\n",
      "12 This  nook really  was like new. I am  thrilled  as my old  one died and I love the plain simple touch. Great  transaction.\n",
      "13 Have enjoyed my B&N Nook, love the fact that you can increase the lettering (fonts) and the glow light is great for reading in the sun or at night.  Use it with my Wi-Fi...\n",
      "14 We used to have the basic NOOK without the light.  It worked fine, but at night we needed a flashlight to read it.  This solves that problem.  We like it.\n",
      "15 Ereader with built in glow light is just awesome! It is everything the NOOK Simple Touch is. I couldn't be any happier.\n",
      "16 I love my Nook glowlight!  It's easy to use and hundreds of books are available to purchase and download.\n",
      "17 I like the light weight of the nook and the light is perfect.  Still going strong a few years later.\n",
      "18 The glow light on this Nook is great for reading in the dark.  This Nook is also great for reading in the bright sunlight.  I bought it for reading at the pool.  I would recommend this Nook to anyone.\n",
      "19 I absolutely love my Nook.  Perfect size to carry around and holds plenty of books.  Definitely happy with my purchase.\n",

      "25 This Nook is amazing. It works perfectly, it has a great battery life, and the fact that it is not backlit makes my heart sing. It's tiny, portable, and even with my case fits perfectly in my purse for my morning commute. I love this product, and I recommend it to EVERYONE.\n",

      "31 I Love my Nook, the only problem I have been having with it is the turn off button seems to be loose, but over all I am so very happy with it. it is my first e-reader  ;) thank you...\n",
      "32 I chose this device based upon,y experience with first generation nook reader.  it is faster and the glow light feature works perfectly.\n",
      "33 The best e-reader on the market. Simple as it says. Great tool for education, and I highly recommend Nook for anyone. Despite the insistance of Barnes and Nobel to make us believe that the use of this product is restricted to the U.S. users, I have to say, It works world wide.\n",
      "34 This is my second Nook and I find it very convenient.\n",
      "35 My nook gets a 5 rating. It has taken reading to a whole new level. I love the glowlight! No need for a library!\n",

      "45 I love my nook! So easy to use and light weight. I carry it with me everywhere! Battery life is awesome too.\n",
      "46 I ordered this as a gift for my son. I have to say...my son LOVES his nook!! The glow light, the feel of paper when turning the pages and the size of the nook is perfect!  I appreciate the seller working with us on the issue with fedex. Glad to be one of their customers!!\n",
      "47 Love my nook! It was everything I expected it to be. It is nice to lay in bed and read without disturbing my husband. I would order from this company again\n",
      "48 I purchased my Nook in January with the intent to use it for international travel.  It has been great - I appreciate that it is inexpensive, light-weight, durable, and easy to use.  I also appreciate how long it can go between charges, which is wonderful when electricity is not a certainty.  I have one observation for those considering its use in the tropics.  I was reading before going to sleep when all of my bunkmates turned off their lights.  As a result, the glowlight was the only source of illumination in the room.  This immediately attracted insects and the larger ones, such as the moths, were capable of turning the virtual pages by walking horizontally across the screen.  Then, one hit the screen so hard that it highlighted a word.  Another moth completed the next command and much to my astonishment, the definition of the word appeared on the screen.  Since it was impossible to continue reading, I turned off the glowlight and moved on to a more sedentary activity!\n",
      "49 I purchased the Nook Simpletouch with Glowlight on Cyber Monday and got a heck of a deal!\n",
      "50 Love it, especially the background light and additional features.  Changes from the previous Nook Glowlight features were sometimes hard to figure out, but seem reasonable once deciphered.\n",
      "51 My husband just love this , he reads it everyday , love the glow light so when its bedtime he doesn't disturb me , great deal , would recommend to everyone ,he has had it for about 5-6 months and has had to only charge twice ,  great product !!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "52 I had some issues first learning it, but now I love my NOOK!! I am very happy with this purchase.\n",

But if you're clever, you can figure out her voicemail access code and learn a little more about her. And you know ... this book is Cathy Vicker's personal journal. If she's in trouble, it might be your duty to poke around in a bit to find out what's going on. But wait -- what's all this crap glued to the inside front cover in a baggie? Newspaper clippings, vital documents, a take out menu, business cards, sketches, a ripped up photo? Aw man. This could become pretty time consuming.\n",
      "2 I originally bought a refurbished First Edition Nook on here for around $30.00 and then I got this one for myself after setting her up and going through a little learning curve as this was my first e-reader experience.\n",
      "3 Horrible experience , bought for my son and broke a few days after receiving it. No refund , nothing. I also emailed back and forward with Barnes and Noble's, who promised a refund for the faulty product. But let us fall through the cracks. Would not recommend,will never buy again!\n",
      "4 Replacing my current nook, had to wait for son to visit to set up. Took it out of the packaging on Thanksgiving day and 2 sons one who managed a B&N store on the past said it would not work. Will try the tech support number.  The used one I previously ordered for my sister worked fine.\n",
      "5 Just purchased the Nook Simple Touch with Glow Light and the power adapter does not slide all the way into the Nook.  I didn't want to put too much pressure on the connector not wanting to ruin the Nook so I took into Best Buy and they gave me a generic power cord which worked fine. Does anyone at the factory where the Nook is made test these products out?  I did a search online about this problem and saw a lot of complaints.  You would think that Nook would have figured it out by now and not send out a product they know isn't going to work.\n",
      "6 I purchased this model when it first came out from Barnes and Noble. It suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason, which should’ve been my first warning. I really liked the size and how the screen wasn’t backlit which made it look more like a real book. So, I decided to give it another shot and bought the same model from amazon. It worked for about 4 years this time, but the screen suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason. I don’t use it every day and store it properly, so there’s no reason it should stop working. Disappointed in the tech problems and I would recommend buying a different model.\n",
      "7 The unit that was sent to me does not power on. I searched on the Internet and a lot of other people have the same issue. It seems there is a problem with the batteries on these units.... They are supposed to last for a long time, but mine did not even power on once. It would be nice for the end user to be able to take the battery out and replace it; I am going to have to send mine back, even though I had to wait a while to get this one and was looking forward to use it, play with it, test it. Ok, so I sent this one back and got the money back, but not the cost to send it back to seller. I bought a second one from another seller. This one powered on, but had other serious issue with it. I tried to insert a micro SD card, but the casing for the card reader was misaligned and my card fell in the device itself. As this could have been labeled as my fault, that I did not pay enough attention to the casing, I did not try to send it back. Plus, I had to take my card out from inside the device somehow. I decided to open the device and forget about warranty to be able to get the card out. I tried to align the casing of the card reader, but instead I managed to break it entirely. The small metal plates broke in one spot and I decided to peel it off completely. I was able to finally put the cover back on the whole device, but without damaging some places of the plastic cover. I figured that 2GB of internal memory would be enough and I would be loading books on it through the USB connector, by connecting to a computer. But it turns out it does not have 2GB available internally to put books on. It only has 250 MB, like other reviewers have mentioned. I do not know if I can root the device without a card reader to put a card in. Have not tried to root it yet, but I read on the internet that it is possible. That would be the obvious solution to many of its software limitations. I went ahead and bought a third device because I really want a book reader with an E-Ink screen that has a card reader and that one seems fine, but I did not played with it much.\n",
      "8 The  GlowLight in the Nook is broken. Why did you not mention about it in the description of the item? The nook is useless.\n",
      "9 I love the Nook Simple Touch, but I am very disappointed in this seller. I bought a Nook advertised as new in December 2018. Six months later it won’t hold a charge, and when I called Barnes & Noble, I was told the one year warranty expired in 2013! No response from seller when asking for a resolution.\n",
      "10 This is the original Nook Simple Touch with glo light, buttons on side.  When I heard the new Nook would not have buttons, I ran to the Barnes & Noble last year and they found some of the Barnes & Noble with glo light  in the back.  When I saw it here I bought my third one.  This is the best version in my opinion.\n",
      "11 This is my first new nook (I had ordered my first ever nook that was used and I enjoyed it for a week till the battery refused to keep a charge, though my seller was kind enough to give me a full refund). So, I'll give my experience with both.\n",
      "12 With two or three major reservations, I think that this is a superb little machine. I have just received it here in Canada, as a belated Christmas gift, and in terms of readability, all its features match the advertising.  This Nook model is not available for sale outside the US, for good reason, though. The WiFi is locked into Barnes & Noble, only.  There is no \"period\", or \"dot\", in the numerical keyboard, so it is not possible to enter another url, either to make a purchase from another bookseller, or, more importantly from my point of view, to log on to the local library (this would appear to apply to local US libraries as well; what a waste of WiFi!). You have to download everything onto your PC and transfer via the cable included. Also, you cannot make a purchase with B&N from outside the US, on this machine.  I don't mind the latter, as I rarely purchase books, anway, but I am disappointed that all these details are not made more clear in the advertising.\n",
      "13 Defective out of the box, this theoretically \"brand new\" reader never had a chance. Seller suggested I return it to the manufacturer. Although they accepted that it was defective, they were only able to credit me a portion of the cost because I hadn't bought it at one of their locations. I'll never know how it performs- because I have replaced it with a Samsung tablet which works perfectly.\n",
      "14 This is my very first e-reader so I did not know this upfront, but unless you register your Nook with BN.com (which I choose not to do because I only bought it to read epubs and pdfs I already own) AND some of your content is purchased directly from BN.com, you will only have 240MB of space on the device.  So in effect, I found myself with 1/8 of the space I thought I'd bought.\n",
      "15 The reader is great except you cant use it until you register it. Went to the library and couldnt get on their wifi to do it. Nor could I use macdonalds where they have the at&t hotspot they promised would work. The nook wouldnt let me do it anywhere but a Barnes and Nobles store so I didnt get to use it for almost 2 weeks. Then I made my first purchase of an ebook...1 book...and they double charged me. once through barnesandnoble.com and again through barnesandnoble/marketplace. They appoligized but wouldnt be putting the money back for 5 days. Since this was cash money they took off my debit card I was just out for days...wonder what would have happened if Id bought 10 books? The nook seems to work great now that I can use it, but using barnes and noble for you ebooks might not be the best idea. They admitted they were having a problem with the double dipping and were trying to fix it. I had it happen 2 years ago when I ordered on line to have paper backs sent to me. So it hasnt been fixed in 2 years:( But I like the nook!\n",
      "16 I love my Nook simple touch but will review another time.  Right now I want to alert everyone not to buy your Simple  Touch from Amazon.  While I love Amazon, I thought I would use my gift cards to purchase my Nook from them rather than going directly to Barnes & Noble.  Was directed to several dealers and selected Ricks Collectibles who had a great rating.  My Nook came quickly and everything seemed OK until I tried to purchase the extended coverage.  Apparently my Nook had been purchased in November at Sears, resold and somehow ended up at Ricks.  Although I purchased it Jan. 3, 30 days had elapsed from the date it was originally purchased it November and I couldn't purchase the service contract.  PLUS, my 1 year warranty actually started in November, so I got gyped there too.  I never realized I was going to run into this trouble when I purchased my Nook and the only reason I bought it this way was to use up my Amazon gift cards.  From what I've read on people's reviews they love the service contract...if they drop their Nook they get a replacement immediately.  If this is important to you....PLEASE DON'T PURCHASE YOUR NOOK FROM AMAZON.\n",
      "17 I am not happy with this product at all, i ordered it for a friend for Christmas. We received a DEMO version of the nook and she was unable to log in and register it for her.I am returning this item and will be purchasing from someone else.\n",
      "18 Glad I was able to get one my wife broke her old one and cant find anything on the market to replace it with.  Ordered another one after I got this one in case she breaks it.\n",
      "19 Unboxed the Nook. Charged it up. Won't connect to my Wifi network when three laptops in my house will. And it won't work at all until you register it. Posts on the Internet say its a complex technical issue. I'm calling the B&N tech people. If they can't fix it fast then this thing is going back. I didn't sign up for hours of struggling with Nook's technical problems. I have better things to do.\n",
      "20 Didn't realize you need a credit card on file to be able to load books onto the Nook. This was a gift for a 17 y/o along with a gift card to order books. She has been unable to actually use this item since she does not have  a credit card and neither do her parents. Should have researched this item more as it has not been very functional for the child I bought it for\n",
      "21 I Ordered 2 of these, one for myself and one for my husband. Started using mine and after a week it started getting these tiny tears within the screen so light was coming through many little spots.  So ended up just taking my husbands since he wasn't using it. Again within 2wks there appeared spots of light coming through. I emailed for an exchange and they said I would have to contact the company direct. I sent an email and got no response. I ended up getting a third one as a gift! You would think 3 times is a charm. Well it wasn't. It took a little longer but it eventually started happening again. I'm back to using the regular nook and using one of those lights u clip on:( I wouldn't even give this one star. It's a big waste of money.\n",
      "22 This is a sold update to the older nook, but gez you have to hit the webs just to find out you need to charge it OVERNIGHT in a WALL PLUG only before first usage AND that it MUST be turned on before trying to connect to windows.  Now knowing these two VERY IMPORTANT points, I can enjoy my \"Nook 2\".\n",
      "23 I bought the Barnes and Noble Ebook and it lasted barely six months.  It won't open the ebook and you can't power it off.  So these are basically junk from this company so save yourself some money and buy elsewhere.  Not a good experience and a lousy product.\n",
      "24 It hasn't worked correctly since i got it.  When i try to type in letters another key inserts it self  When trying to turn it off, i press turn off and the cancel button comes on instead.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "25 I tried several times to set up my account but kept getting an error.  I finally had to go online to set up my account.  Also, I don't see how to set parental controls.  I should have done my homework before purchasing.\n",
      "26 I lost my original Nook so looked at Barnes & Noble for a replacement. Now they don't stock this model, so bought it here. It has an SD card slot which I wanted & the newer model from B&N doesn't have.\n",
      "27 This review is for the Seller.  I purchased this refurbished supposedly \"like New\" condition from Speedy Mobile a little over 3 months ago which is past time to leave a rating and feedback for this seller. Now the on/off switch on the back doesn't work properly, the screen flickers anytime you move from page to page, and the plug in on the bottom is loose and has some kind of short in it so that when you plug the cord in the whole thing goes of and on continuously. The seller said \"sorry\" but did nothing so beware buying anything refurbished you are s**t out of luck. Would not buy from this seller again.\n",
      "28 This thing has not worked right since I received it! You read three or four pages and it will freeze every time. I bought one from my daughter and have not had a problem with that one!\n",
      "29 Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter.  She dropped it and it cracked in the corner; Barnes and Noble replaced it; no questions asked. Can't ask for better then that.\n",
      "30 I purchaed this Nook for my husband and it is not worth the money. I charged it like the book said to and in trying to use it the screen flickers and freezes up. I sent it back with in 48 hours and after 10 emails back in forth they refunded  my money but charged me a 12% restocking fee. I felt it was WRONG to pay a restocking fee when the unit was not even working right. DO NOT BUY !!!!1\n",
      "31 This one won't turn on, despite being fully charged. Won't reset either. My wife wanted to replace her previous nook (same model, works great) because our cats damaged the screen.\n",
      "32 The Barnes & Noble Nook stop working after 3 weeks. The nook was returned to the seller for a replacement one.\n",
      "33 Wife bought this for her elderly mother - but she couldn't quite get the hang of using it (tech challenged)... My wife has been using it instead and seems to like it pretty well... All is good :)\n",
      "34 I bought this for my wife, but now she wishes she had a tablet that could download apps. I tried to get her to let me send it back for an upgrade - but she said, \"Aw, its ok.\" That is not what I want to hear from my wife ever again. If you love your partner and yourself - upgrade it for your own benefit.\n",
      "35 This reader is apparently a older version with a known problem,  in that the back light burns so strongly that it burns through the inner white coating on the screen.  my daughter noticed dark spots on the screen about a week into using it, and took it to Barnes and Noble to ask about it. Fortunately, they were nice enough to replace it with the newer, white model. Would not recommend buying the black version to anyone.\n",
      "36 Worked in my Nook, however I had to put it in my pc to format it before I could get it to work.\n",
      "37 Had to have a wifi connection to work which I do not have. Returned unit for a Kindle.\n",
      "38 The first time I turned the product on, the screen was flickering consistantly, making reading a book difficult.  I returned the product, as I deemed it as defective, and have been having issues for two weeks with trying to get my refund processed.  Will not purchase from this seller again.  On a side note, Amazon customer service has been very helpful in trying to get this situation straighted out.\n",
      "39 I bought two Nooks, one for me and the other for my wife. One of them started to have problems as from day 2, the battery ran-out too quickly and had to recharge it permanently. I contacted Barnes & Noble to have it replaced and each time a different representative asked me the same questions over and over and gave me different -contradictory- directions to proceed for replacement. Of course it wasn't replaced, it was a complete deception. The product does not work as advertised, if you ever have a problem Barnes & Noble won't even bother to help and they will make their best for you to lose your patience and leave it as trash at home. I thank Barnes & Noble for a terrible shopping experience and the worst product offer.\n",
      "40 \"I attempted to contact the seller on 12/27, but received no response. The item was listed as brand new, but when I gifted it to my son-in-law for Christmas, he discovered that it was a Demo unit meaning he couldn't download any of his own books. I'd still like to have a functional Nook sent to my son-in-law, but if the seller remain uncooperative, I will settle for a refund.\"  Update:  So before going through this huge hassle of returning and waiting on a replacement, etc., I tried a system restore last night on the Nook.  That feature was locked down when the Nook was on, but when I powered it off, I was able to find an online guide to trigger a system restore using the keys on the unit.  That proved successful!  After about 10 minutes, the unit came back up, and all features were unlocked.  I was able to login to my account, access my books, and do everything on it that I could with my previous unit.  No features were grayed out, etc.\n",
      "41 no it was a horrible experience we bought this item a a gift for my  mother in law and upon her  opening it and  turning on the light to only discover their  was dots all  over the screen... she had to  take  time out of  her holiday to return it to a Barnes and noble  very disappointing\n",
      "42 NEVER BUY FROM THEM!!!!! THE LOWEST QUALITY PRODUCTS!!!!! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!I would have given you zero stars if I could!!! I will just attach a photo of my nook. You can see how it looks like after less than 2 months of using it. They have refused to help me, to give me back any money or fix it!!!! So what- I am buying something, it breaks a little bit after I buy it and then I am stuck with my broken nook!!!!! NEVER BUY FROM THEM!​​​​\n",
      "43 Item arrived with a pinpoint crack which let light through the screen. Seller would not help at all. Contacted Barnes and Noble who after replaced after a lengthy call.\n",
      "44 Unfortunately the Nook is already broken.  Does anyone do repairs?  Thank you for your assistance.\n",
      "45 This stupid thing died on me within the first 3 months. The screen froze and it would not power on. I called Barnes and Noble and they said that they didn't have that serial number on file. Hmmmmm....\n",
      "46 Very sorry I purchased 2 of these.They do not work for people living outside of the USA!! They were happy to sell these to us (yes I stupidly bought 2- one for my husband....)....yet as we live in Australia, we cannot buy any books online for it!! Also the touch screen doesnt work very well.I have to press on the screen many times before I get it to go to where I want it to!! An absolute dud! :(\n",
      "47 i've had this device for a year or so, but really only used it on vacation a few times. i charged it up the other day and discovered that it would not connect to my wifi. here is a short version of the events that followed:\n",
      "48 I've spent so much time with B & N customer service, I haven't had as much time as I'd like to learn all the features of the Nook Simple Touch. The first day I spent registering it, learning how to access the features, accessing our Wi-Fi, etc. Only after I learned how to turn on the GlowLight did I realize it had a defective display screen and obviously I needed to return it. After calling their customer service, then attempting to explain the problem to a woman who, I assume, understood me better than I understood her, she agreed that I needed it replaced. This phone call seemed to go on for an hour or so, with my trying to understand what she was telling me about their detailed instructions for returns and replacements by mail. In frustration, I finally asked if I couldn't simply return it to their store. After checking, she said they didn't have any in stock.\n",
      "49 I hate this product. Actually, you know what? I don't hate the product, because with one exception, it's not so bad - I hate the Barnes and Noble Customer Service that came WITH this product.\n",
      "50 What a hassle. Two Nook basics. One without and one with Glowlight. My failures caused the screen to freeze displaying a Salvador Dali like scribble of lines and patches. Used the NOOK charger. Never left my bedside. There are no motors,magnets or anything else with fifteen feet that could have caused this. Had a real nightmare with Barnes & Noble about updating my ship to address. Five years and what, seventy tries online and the site defaulted t my old address. Called customer service. \"Oh I am correcting that right this minute\" a young man said as I could hear keyboard strokes over the phone. Two weeks later they shipped a replacement to the old address. They want a hundred dollars for a gizmo that costs as much as some basic smart phones. And it breaks. The phones are still working, taking images, playing music but the NOOK cannot display print and chew gum at the same time. Don't even bother going to the B&N site for book reviews. It is a drop box for drug dealer messages. Barnes and Noble is setting themselves up for a Chapter 13.\n",
      "51 I have a nook with glolight and in general it is fine. Increasingly, howeve, it freezes up for no reason and I have to completely shut it down to get it to work. This increasing insensitivity is concerning because I have an older model Nook without glolight and its screen is now completely insensitive. No matter what I press the Home page comes up. If I can get into the Settings mode to try and connect with a new wireless network, whenever I try to type in a new password, no matter what key I press, the key to the far left of that row lights up.Booooooooo\n",
      "52 I bought my 14 year old stepdaughter a Nook as a graduation gift.  Although I LOVE my Kindle I thought she would like something different, so I got her the Glowlight.  I purchased a gift card and was just setting up an account when I discovered I had to have a credit card on file - even though there is a gift card registered to the account!  A just finished chatting with customer service and was told that the credit card is required in order for the order to go through electronically.  I was not happy about that, but okay fine.  I will just set up the account so it will not charge my credit card if the gift card balance goes to low.  Guess what - YOU CAN'T DO THAT!!  You can password protect the device for purchases - which will keep someone else from purchasing if you lose it; but that same password allows access to the credit card on file if you don't have enough of a balance on the gift card.  I am thinking of selling this and getting her a Kindle, which I myself have been perfectly happy with.  Should have gone with my first instinct and bought a Kindle in the first place.\n",
      "53 Comments for Amazon purchases I really hate having to write comments for any item I purchased I feel that the star rating is sufficient to let anyone know how I feel about the product if I really dislike of product I may take the time to write about it or I would just return it that is my comment.\n",
      "54 Gift to my daughter, unfortunately it left mark on cover after removing sticker! Why put a sticker on cover?!\n",
      "55 I have used Nook readers since they came out. That being said, do not buy this version. I have had 3.....all within the same year. All 3 have experienced the screen having \"tears\" when the glow light is on. That I can live with. The problem I have had with all 3 is freezing, battery discharging, and unresponsiveness. The one I am using now has to be plugged in at all times, or the battery drains within an hour. I've given up on customer support, they just tell me to reset it ( which I do, but it doesn't fix the problem). I am back to using my original Nook, which still works great, or my black and white without the glow light, which also still works great. Avoid the black and white glow light. Seriously.\n",
      "Cluster #: 9\n",
      "0 I caught this one on the bargain shelf at Barnes and Noble. The whole packaging just drew me in (not to mention the $6 price!). The drawings, the package of stuff at the beginning, the whole journal set-up. For the price, I decided to give it a try.\n",
      "1 I thought it was an awesome read! I passed it on to my step-sister! Very interacie and very much worth the price ... If you don't want to call the number then you can go on the provided website and hear the message. Lets you get a feel for what the charictors look like and what kind of people they are.\n",
      "2 I am so pleased with this item.  It was so much more than I expected for the great price.  The seller was quick to politely respond when I had questions about the product before purchasing.  The item arrived a week earlier than the estimated date.  The product says used but looks and works like new, still in box, with charger.  I bought this for my father for Christmas to replace the Gen 1 I had previously given him (used) malfunctioned after about 7 years of use.  We love the nook and this new one with the glow light is going to be great for him.  The wifi connected with ease, Barns&Noble books loaded, and transferring epubs over from the computer using Calibre was a breeze.  I am so pleased.  I think he will be too.\n",
      "3 I bought this used from a student. The seller added a handy case, which I've since personalized with a single sticker.\n",
      "4 It is great! i could not be happier with this purchase, i use it all the time when i'm traveling and even when i'm home. Instead of going out to buy books, i download them from my public library and they are  automatically returned when the lending period is over. Saves me the trip!\n",
      "5 I bought this for my mom for Christmas 2013, I luckily have a job and am in college so I did have a little extra money to give my parents something special this Christmas. I mom kept mentioning the Nook GlowLight and I ended up buying a used version from Unclaimed Baggage (Shout Out!) she loves it very much, my mom is 53 and got used to the touch screen very quickly, she has a 4 page library of Nook Books today.\n",
      "6 This is an excellent product and the price is right! I have purchased one of these for my grandson, my grand daughter, my daughter and my best friend and now this one is for ME!  When I saw the price of this nook I thought it was time I treat myself and I absolutely love it! My grandson shows me how to load my books and it is so much easier for me to hold this and read than it is to \"flip pages\" I can also carry this in my pocketbook with ease without it taking up space, what a great invention. Little did I realize what a great gift I was giving until I got my own and I am saving tons of money not buying books! You can even set your font to the size you want so you don't have to squint to read, this is really a fantastic gadget!\n",
      "7 I think, the title sums up my opinion about this purchase good enough, but since I need to write 20+ words about it as well, here it goes.\n",
      "8 This is my second of the old version. Dropped the first one in my pool and thought for sure it would never work again but 2days of drying it out in a bag of rice and it's working perfectly. So now I have one I take to pool and my back up stays on nightstand. Great price and outstanding service. I had new one before old one dried out. Love this company...\n",
      "9 Ordered this to replace the simple touch I had. Price was very reasonable for a refurb. It arrived quickly and looked brand new. The glowlight feature is awesome! Couldn't be happier with this! Thank you!!\n",
      "10 I bought it and love it.\n",
      "11 I purchased this device new through Amazon Marketplace from JJ's RealBuy.\n",
      "12 I Ordered two by accident didn't think the first order had gone thru. anyway on the order after writing to the seller to see if they could mail ASAP they did at no extra cost to me so my grandson got it for his birthday. On the return of the other they have been gracious and approved the return which will be mailed back today or  Monday. They have been wonderful  to work with and very kind  to a senior citizen that sometimes messes up(orders). Thank you soooo much for your kindness and my grandson loves the Nook.\n",
      "13 This has been such a great product for me that I bought a second one after stepping on my old one.\n",
      "14 I purchased this nook for a friend who was retireing.  She has had hand surgery and has difficulty with heavy objects.  She loves her nook simple touch.  She takes it everywhere she goes.  Fits easily in a purse or briefcase even a backpack.  It is easy to order and download books.  She even ordered magazines.  Great gift for anyone from toddlers to great grand parents.  Excellent for students.\n",
      "15 appears and works as described....received promptly.  When Kindle was defective, returned it and ordered this....It has\n",
      "16 started freezing up 6 months after purchase. eventually ended up replacing it. glad to have purchased square trade replacement plan.\n",
      "17 Product arrived sooner than shipping estimate, which was a wonderful surprise.  We bought this to replace one that my husband short-circuited, and it's already up and running.  We like the small size.. easier to tote around than the larger ones.  Had thought about upgrading, but why mess with success.  It's a shame B&N isn't carrying them anymore, bigger is not necessarily better in our opinion.\n",
      "18 I ordered this for my husband who is in the navy and was leaving on an 8 month deployment the day of his birthday.  I was SO EXCITED to have thought of such a useful gift as I figured we could download a ton of books and he would have reading material on ship without having to pack 40 books.\n",
      "19 I gave two of these to my two grandchildren and they screamed when they opened then and they like them very much.\n",
      "20 I liked the Nook Simple Touch that I purchased and the price was right, but I purchased this model by mistake. I thought it had the glow light and it didn't (my bad!). The company took it back without a problem and charged me a minimal restocking fee. Thanks for understanding!\n",
      "21 The price is very good compare to the store. I received the item quickly. The visibility is very good under the sun, I recommand this item.\n",
      "22 Bought this as a gift for my father-in-law and he has not put it down since! Great buy for the money. Quality is top notch. I would buy one again in a heartbeat. Came packaged very well for shipping.\n",
      "23 Great find and great price . More than I expected ,easy read at night . Would\n",
      "24 Bought it for my wife, she uses it every day.  Haven't had any issues with the device or the selection of books.  Would definitely buy it again!\n",
      "25 I actually bought this book to do some book folding for my husband.  He loves Sherlock Holmes.  The book was in fantastic condition, and the pages were easy to fold, so I'm very pleased with this purchase.  It made a wonderful & inexpensive anniversary gift for my hubby, and he loves it.\n",
      "26 Product is great, packaging was great so item arrived in perfect condition. Shipping was painfully long. Shipped on September 12th arrived on October 16 so I'm not sure what's up with that, but it's here and being thoroughly enjoyed by the friend I ordered it for. Thanks\n",
      "27 Purchased two Nooks with Glowlights.  They arrived very promptly.  One was in perfect condition.  The other had a tear under the screen.  The Seller was very cooperative in offering a refund or replacement.  We elected to replace it.  The replacement was in perfect condition.\n",
      "28 Ordered this product for a family memeber . Excellent service from Barnes and Noble on set up and operation. I would highly reocommend this product for anyone who likes to read\n",
      "29 I was hesitant to purchase a refurbished product but after using it I would never have guessed that it wasn't brand new. I am highly impressed with it and recommend to anyone that is leery about it.\n",
      "30 It was a little spendy (because I can be cheap) but the overall product was great! Didn't want to deal with the return when I got another one for less. So I gave it to my other sister. They both love their nooks.\n",
      "31 very very good value for this reader, and I am grateful for the quick exchange they made when the first unit developed a problem right away.  They immediately sent a replacement.  Immediately.\n",
      "32 I bought this one to replace an old one that stopped working.\n",
      "33 It was a brand new Nook in package, it came with a great case that I like better than the one we bought with our other Nook.  Great price, may have to get another for my little girl.\n",
      "34 I did enjoy it for a while but the limitations were to great.  It did as it was supposed to and still worked ( after a little calibrating ) after working its way out from under the bungee on my motorcycle and doing a couple of end over ends. Finally I bought an E Book and gave the nook to my grandson. My daughter says he loves it\n",
      "35 Great product, I love how small it is. Makes it extremely easy to bring along with me to school or on road trips.  Haven't been able to use it as much as I would like but I am looking forward to use it.\n",
      "36 Bought this when it was 34 dlls but I think they went a little high on the price since then...\n",
      "37 I bought it for a good friend. She loved it and said it was the only one her school would let her use to get school books.  It will save her a lot of money.\n",
      "38 The product was excellent for a great price.  The amount of time that is was shipped it was faster than I thought it would be.\n",
      "39 It got here very quickly. It was a gift for my mom and she uses it all the time. She loves it. It was easy for her to learn how to use and she reads off of it almost everyday. It is a great product.\n",
      "40 Love it. Easy to use, can carry it in my jacket pocket. I take it everywhere I go. So glad I bought it.\n",
      "41 I've been deployed for a bit and can definitely appreciate a speedy shipment from the states (5-8 days). If it's that fast to get to a whole other country I can only imagine the quickness in the states. My brand new nook arrived with not one hiccup and expect nothing less from Amazon.\n",

      "48 I have long loved ereaders. I had the original Nook and used it until they cam out with this model. I have had it for a year now and love it. I bought two more for my parents which is why I am doing this review.\n",

      "50 Loved it. Well written, kept my interest and was true to who Holmes and Watson are. Well worth the purchase price. Gave it to my picky Son afterward and sure he will like it.\n",
      "51 Works great , has more features than I thought it did and well worth the price I would buy again\n",

I see the days of the text-book becoming a thing of the past. Get this, you'll be very satisfied. Easy on the eyes. Great Job B&N.\n",
      "54 Let me start off by saying that I own the first generation Nook and love it. The only disappointment is its weight. I have also bought a Nook Tablet for my father. I believe in BN and think of them as the underdog and I always support the underdog. I appreciate that they decided to use the ePub format, unlike other proprietary companies.\n",
      "55 i love my Nook with glowlight and have had it for a year with no problems.  I bought my mom the new simpletouch with glowlight thinking it would be just as great.  WRONG. after two days the glowlight went out.  I returned it and got another one.  One week later the glowlight goes out AGAIN.  I return it and get another one.  It is now less than a month after buying it and I am on my third device.  Today the touchscreen decides it wants to work sometimes and sometimes not. REALLY?  I will be returning it and getting a Kindle Paperwhite.\n",
      "56 My wife loves it, and the screen is so crisp. I might just have to get one for myself.\n",

      "Cluster #: 10\n",
      "0 So many small details and work went into developing this story. They made this an entire detective story with actual evidence. Incredible!\n",
      "1 From calling phone numbers to checking evidence, playing detective is the most fun of Cathy's Book.  The reader becomes Emma, Cathy's best friend, who is left with a journal filled with numbers, evidence, and a story that will blow your mind!\n",
      "2 I am no expert but I have read all of Conan Doyle's Holmes novels and short stories plus a number of pastiches of Sherlock Holmes.  I recommend The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes to anyone who has never read this material.  Much like wading into the ocean (instead of running and diving), the Adventures offer small samplings of Conan Doyle's work without intimidating the reader. Considering how well-deservedly famous they are,  I do not intend to insinuate that these stories are lesser than the novels but that they offer a simpler and quicker tasting of the material.  The Adventures are well-written but in smaller form and easier to digest.  The stories are indeed mysteries but their subject matter and length do not lend themselves to a long denouement or extensive flashback as in A Study In Scarlet or The Sign Of The Four. Sampling these shorter works might encourage a new reader to venture further into the canon and educate his or her literary palate.\n",
      "3 This was my first foray into Sherlock Holmes and Arthur Conan Doyle. I bought this Kindle edition because it had Whispersync to the audiobook edition. I, like most people in the English-speaking world, had heard of Sherlock Holmes but had never read any of the stories or books until now. I love the style of writing, the vocabulary that Arthur Conan Doyle uses and the vivid descriptions he illustrates with his writing. Sherlock Holmes is the epitome of genius when it comes to investigating and deducing facts, but the way he arrives at his solutions is so intriguing. I also really enjoyed the relationship between Holmes and Watson and the equally intriguing flaws that Holmes has, vis-á-vis, tobacco and cocaine. It makes him a bit more fallible; a little more real. I've subsequently bought A Study in Scarlet and The Hound of the Baskervilles (because they too have Whispersync with audiobook), to continue my newly discovered love of old classics.\n",
      "4 Reading these stories brings the atmosphere of 1880-90s London back as thick as the fog.  I thoroughly enjoyed the exploits of Holmes and Watson as they unravel the problems presented to the famous detective.  I feel as if I'm sitting in the drawing room on Baker Street warming by the fire with our heros as Watson and I observe Holmes' mind churning his inexorable logic until the solution presents itself.  The stories in this collection are among the best and most popular of the Holmes mysteries.  The Speckled Band and Orange Pips in particular are frequently rated near the top and are a delight at each reading.  These are classic detective stories at their best.  The stories are easy reading, yet well written, and bite-size for a quick mental snack.  The short stories are perfect for grabbing up and reading one or two while you are between appointments, although I found myself devouring the whole thing in a few sittings, not able to read just one.  I read these on my Kindle, with links to the beginning of each story, and well formatted.  The only exception to this is a problem displaying the British Pound symbol.  However, this does nothing to hinder one's understanding or reading experience.  I highly recommend this collection for any fan of the genre.\n",
      "5 The adventures that this one includes is A Scandal in Bohemia, The Red-Headed League, A Case of Identity, The Boscombe Valley Mystery, The Five Orange Pips, The Man with the Twisted Lip, The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle, The Adventure of the Speckled Band, The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb, The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor, The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet, and The Adventure of the Copper Beeches. The flow of it was easy to follow and even being in the dark and coming into a story midstride sometimes was well thought through. You don't feel bogged down with too many details, nor do you feel left out of some. At first I didn't like not getting some descriptions before hand, but I know including them would only have cluttered the writing with too many details.\n",
      "6 I have three of nooks and they are great.  Two of them are glolite which is great for reading in the dark\n",
      "7 This is a beautiful presentation of a literary classic.  It may seem hard to believe, but Conan Doyle was an important influence on the entire field of criminal investigation.  Before Sherlock Holmes, there was little emphasis on scientific examination of crime scenes or evidence.  Doyle's characterization of Inspector Lestrade as a plodder seems to have been quite correct and quite typical..  With the debut of Sherlock Holmes in A Study in Scarlet there was suddenly an example of what was possible. The explanations of his approach and method caused real detectives to question themselves and say \"I could do that\".  And slowly but surely they did too.  And Holmes set the change in motion.\n",
      "8 This is the second audio book I have that is read by Simon Prebble.  He is a very gifted narrator.  There are many stories included and he sounds just like Basil Rathbone who has always been my favorite Holmes.  He can sound like so many different characters.\n",
      "9 Doyle created an enduring character that, through various iterations over the decades, has become one of the most easily recognizable and most admired detectives. What is interesting, however, is that through reading the originals, I find that Holmes seemed to stretch the bonds of credulity with his deductions. Either that, or Watson was not the best narrator in his documenting of the cases. Still they are a fun read and certainly have made for some great viewing over the years.\n",
      "10 This classic work is both interesting and informative, my dear Watson. The stories vary, but all are intriguing, showcasing the observation skills of the Master Detective. Truth be known, Dr Watson contributed much to the work, and I believe he was an actual person. Holmes had a drug habit, not illegal at that time, and probably an effort to hold his tremendous intellect in check. Eventually, he overcame it, and took a few years sabbatical, as it were, where he dropped out of sight to peruse the world cultures outside of England. I enjoyed reviewing the stories again, having read them years ago as a erstwhile detective. Some might say the book is \"elementary\" but the depth is cleverly hidden.\n",
      "11 It was great to read the original Sherlock Holmes stories & see how well the PBS Sherlock Holmes show captured the earn e of who Sherlock Holmes was as written by Doyle!\n",
      "12 Though written over one-hundred years ago, it is a reminder that humanity generally remains the same.  There have always been scoundrels, and those that hunt them down and expose them.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle writes of the brilliant, observant and excentric detective Sherlock Holmes and his adventurous cases with his trusted friend Dr. Watson.\n",
      "13 Reading British mysteries is my kind of fun.  Especially the old ones!  Doyle was a master.  Engaging, witty, serious and ever so detailed!\n",
      "14 I suggest every one read at least on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's master pieces. Sherlock is a wonderfully snarky and dry person counterpointed by Watson's absolute curiosity and charm. Seriously if you haven't give it a go. The language and pace can be a little drawn out sometimes, but it was written in Victorian tradition. That's what makes it a wonderful read.\n",
      "15 yet another sherlock narrator, this one we like from the dick francis novels, and didn't disappoint\n",
      "16 Like a lot of people, I came to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock stories from the other adaptations of the character. Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd century, The Great Mouse Detective, the BBCs recent Sherlock series, etc.\n",
      "17 He never lived but he is one of the most recognized ' persons' on the planet.  The power of the written word.  I believe that 221B Baker Street in London is a tourist attraction.  Check it out .  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle- his creator- is said to be by some --the father of modern forensic medicine.  My grankids- from the youngest to the teens enjoy watching his movies- even in black and white!!\n",
      "18 I really enjoyed reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works in this short collection of Sherlock Holmes stories. It was entertaining and interesting to read. These works and Sherlock Holmes are classics always to be remembered.\n",
      "19 The misty chords of memory are awakened by the recollections of Dr. John Watson regarding a tantalizing, dark tale of intertwined mysteries reaching to the highest levels of British society.\n",
      "20 I’m glad I had the chance to read The House of Silk ad it was a great reading experience and way to start off the new year. I think that Horowitz does a phenomenal job in keeping in tune with the spirit of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s original Sherlock Holmes tales and novels. The mood, atmosphere and feeling of the book is very Sherlockian and there are many staples that I think Holmes’ fans (or even non-fans) will enjoy. In other words, I think any crime or mystery fan will find something to enjoy about this novel.\n",
      "21 Horowitz manages to completely capture the voice of Dr. Watson and Arthur Conan Doyle in a new story that sounds like an original but becomes bigger, more complicated and more suited to modern readers. Most stories written as homages trot out one element after another, generally with no purpose other than to ensure nostalgic bliss from the readers. This novel is long enough to bring most of the major familiar characters from a Holmes adventure, but each one is used skillfully and purposefully, never feeling forced.\n",
      "22 Mr. Horowitz has done it again. I've been a fan of Foyle's War and Midsomer Murders for years and a serious student of \"The Canon\" of Sir Arthur for even more years. So I was very interested in seeing how Mr. Horowitz would approach a Holmesian pastiche. And, not surprisingly, it was done well with appropriate references to events, persons and places detailed in \"The Canon.\"\n",
      "23 It's a nice enough book and it tries to recapture the style of Arthur Conan Doyle but it is not exactly there. If I was able to split the stars it would have been 3.5 but pressed to pick, I would say 3 rather than 4 because it is really nothing special - neither the Holmes is standard Holmes nor the style is standard style and it is my understanding that the primary task was to emulate Doyle's writing. Also, the plot has one twist too many...\n",
      "24 I have never been a big fan of the Arthur Conan Doyle novels, but found this modern take on the classic Sherlock Holmes thriller to be an engrossing and riveting read. The dialogue was pure Victorian in style, but not heavy or pedantic. The plot was just intricate enough to keep me guessing nearly to the end--something I have always loved about the best Agatha Christie novels, which I AM a big fan of. It grabbed me so fully that I am going to move on to the next of this author's Holmes novels: Moriarty. I recommend The House of Silk to anyone who loves an old-world who-dunnit, and even to those who normally don't. It's elementary, dear Watson!\n",
      "25 The characterizations of Holmes and Watson were entertaining--characterizations B+. The mystery I literally solved from the title. Seriously, Scooby Doo has more surprises, so plot moves along but....C-.  Overall prose style is not bad. If you put the original Conan Doyle as a 'A' and the masters of prose like Jane Austen into another category entirely, then the book is a solid B. But life is short and Conan Doyle, Poe, Le Carre are all A and I don't even follow the mystery genre\n",
      "26 You don't know how happy I was to come across  this book and find \"the game is afoot\" once again.  As a devotee of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, I searched for \"what to read after Sherlock Holmes\" and came across \"House of Silk\".  Horowitz  is amazing - he has captured Doyle's voice perfectly, presented a convincing, multi-layered mystery which engages the reader from start to finish.  Absolutely loved it!  Would highly recommend it Sherlockian fans and will be reading more of Horowitz - obviously a very talented writer.\n",
      "27 Sherlock Holmes has entertained readers since his first appearance in 1887, with Arthur Conan Doyle's A Study in Scarlet. With the publication of The House of Silk, Anthony Horowitz becomes the first author to receive approval from the Conan Doyle Estate to publish a new Sherlock Holmes novel. The world's most famous consulting detective returns in a tale both immensely convoluted, and intriguing to the very last detail.\n",
      "28 A great, fun read. Really true to the characters from the Sherlock Holmes series. I enjoyed this as much as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories. It does touch on a dark crime that no one would ever have written about in the 1800s, but the characters reacted in the manner you would have expected in a Sherlock mystery. This book satisfied my Sherlock fix since the PBS series ended (or is on hiatus).\n",
      "29 A new Sherlock Holmes mystery from the man who brought us \"Foyle's War?\" Yes, please.\n",
      "30 I'm so glad I've been introduced to Anthony Horowitz before I get too old to read and enjoy his work! After enjoying The Word is Murder, I decided I had to read The House of Silk since I've read so many of the Holmes' stories. I had to see if a modern writer could capture the London world of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. The answer is YES! Horowitz has done a masterful job; I felt all the time as if I were reading Doyle himself. And the plot is as clever and confounding as any of his. A wonderful read that tempts me to read more == of Doyle, but also of Horotitz.\n",
      "31 The author succeeds brilliantly in recreating the world of Sherlock Holmes, brought to us (as ever) by his faithful friend Dr. Watson.  Sherlock is Sherlock; Watson is Watson plus a bit more thoughtfulness than he usually displays.  The style and voices are perfect.  Great escape, in two senses.\n",
      "32 True Holmes fans will not be disappointed by this novel -- and I say that as one who has read \"The Complete Sherlock Holmes\" from cover to cover,  multiple times.  Two stories are interwoven here.  The first concerns a prominent art dealer who fears he is being followed by an old enemy.  The second concerns the fate of one of Holmes street boys whom he calls \"The Baker Street Irregulars.\"  There's plenty of excitement as Holmes and Watson unravel the puzzle.  Most important to me, though, was that Horowitz managed to channel Arthur Conan Doyle's writing style so completely that I was thoroughly satisfied.  The story line has some modern themes which Conan Doyle would not have dealt with, but Horowitz has handled that in part by having the tale told by an aged Watson.  I disagree with the reviewers who felt this Holmes was too weepy or troubled -- I feel that Holmes' reactions were not excessive and were in keeping with the serious events portrayed in the story.  I hope Horowitz publishes more Holmes stories.\n",
      "33 A sparkling Holmes yarn--well-keeping in the style of Doyle. Adventure and action and plot twists that charm and bewilder the reader all at once. Horowitz created the great BBC series Foyle's War and now he's given us a Holmes tale to read, remember, and enjoy. American train bandits blow up a train inadvertently destroying a shipment of extremely valuable Constable paintings. Thanks to a reward put out by the collector and an English art dealer, most of the gang is destroyed in America but now the art dealer is frightened that the leader escaped and is tracking him down in England to exact vengeance. He calls in Holmes to protect him. Events seem to make this more of a familial matter than one of art appreciation and vengeance. Lestrade returns and is actually helpful to Holmes, sort of. A lovely action and opium and art filled tale that should appear near the top of the Zillion and one Non-Canonical Holmes adventures. I bought this item from Amazon--no one gave it to me, even though I have reviewed in scores of publications for over thirty years.\n",
      "34 If you haven't read any of Conan Doyle's stories, they are a must read for any mystery enthusiast - and even those who are not! They are a collection that surpasses the passing of time with plot twists and turns that are guaranteed to keep any reader spellbound page after page.\n",
      "35 The plots of these adventures, as well as the methods that are employed by Holmes are legendary and I have enjoyed many of the movies and television programmes which have been based on them, but the writing in this collection is a pleasure to read. I highly recommend this book to those who appreciate a well-written and well-constructed mystery.\n",
      "36 For fans of Holmes and Watson this tale will at first seem too simple, more like one of Watson's short stories than a full-fledged novel. But read on. The game is indeed afoot, and very mysterious it is, too, with ample twists and turns. Yet it circles back around to the initial story eventually, and ties it all together neatly. It receives four stars instead of five because it seems to possess a few (very minor) turns of phrase that seem just a bit too modern. The core plot, also, is I think influenced strongly by modern sensibilities. But, unless you are well-versed in the Canon you won't even notice these things. A worthy addition to the collection of Holmes pastiches that compares very well with others (I am fond of those by Nicholas Meyer myself). Bravo.\n",
      "37 For years now I have admired Anthony Horowitz for the fine writing he has done for the Poirot, Midsomer Murders TV series and his\n",
      "38 Starts off brightly, weaving various Doyle-like threads: the tale of theft and violence in a faraway place, the mysterious watcher outside the country house possibly seeking revenge, Holmes' remarkable deductions. But the whole thing quickly goes off the rails, descending into violence and derring-do that seems quite out of place in a Holmes mystery. What is more, anyone who has read a book will quickly divine what the House of Silk is even before the clues start rolling in.  Who the various villains are is obvious almost from the moment they are introduced. You don't have to be Holmes to spot the revealing statements, or figure from the circumstances who is responsible for a particular crime. (In one case, it simply could not be anyone else, which sort of ruins the mystery.) I kept expecting to be proven wrong in some remarkable and entertaining way. Alas, the only reason to keep reading the story is to find out exactly why the villains are the villains. That revelation manages to be both tortured and ludicrous, even employing the \"Murder She Wrote\" deceit of revealing various clues at the denouement that the reader was not privy to until that moment.\n",
      "39 As a lover of the Canon, I was impressed with the feeling that I was reading a true Holmes' case.  I think the author was faithful to his “ten rules.”  I also think that they were spot on and led to the great pleasure I had reading the book.\n",
      "40 Having grown up reading Conan Doyle's original works I am especially critical of authors attempting to emulate his style in creating new Sherlock Holmes stories.  Nicholas Meyer's Seven Percent Solution stands out as a notable exception to a number of others who have tried and failed to capture the style of the original Holmes mysteries.  Horowitz has achieved an astonishingly perfect novel that Dr. Watson could not have written any better.  The atmosphere of Victorian London is wonderfully recreated as well as the pacing and authenticity of the dialog between Holmes and Watson.  If you had only a passing familiarity with the Holmes stories you would be hard pressed to distinguish House of Silk from the original tales.  If you have loved Conan-Doyle's accounts of the famous consulting detective I strongly recommend this novel to your reading list.  I truly hope this isn't Horowitz' last adventure of Holmes and Watson\n",
      "41 Anthony Horowitz has achieved what others have tried and failed...to not only successfully write as A.C. Doyle / Dr. Watson, but to depict Sherlock Holmes as Watson depicted him and in the language and setting of the times. In reading The House of Silk I actually thought I as reading A.C. Doyle...and thoroughly enjoyed it!!! IT is so nice to be able to read more of Holmes and Watson and the further adventures. I've been a fan since a young boy and gladly grew old with them,\n",
      "42 As a BIG fan of all things Sherlock Holmes, I was excited to read this book! I think the author did a good job of capturing the mood of the original stories, describing a dark underbelly of crime in London, and staying true to the characterization of Holmes and Watson.\n",
      "43 This is another Sherlock Holmes interesting read ...... As the storyteller Dr. Watson describes in detail the plot of the story and, rather than being boring, the detail adds to the enjoyment of the novel ...kudos to the author for continuing the legend of Sherlock Holmes ... I understand that the discovery of what was going on at the House of Silk is a current situation but I would have preferred a less disturbing way to tie up the loose ends of the plot ...overall it was a very good read\n",
      "44 I love Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes . To me Anthony Horowitz's  versions are the best offered!  I enjoy how he writes as if he is in the 19 th century, even to the cadences of speech.\n",
      "45 A nice group of short stories narrated by Dr Watson.  I love seeing the logic at play.  A fun, relaxing read.\n",
      "46 Crime stories that are a good read. Written in the vernacular, which is as interesting as the stories. Sherlock is the father of CSI. His instant deductions, based on his power of observation are always interesting. This is a book to read again and again.\n",
      "47 Even if you are not a Conan Doyle fan, you can enjoy Anthony Horowitz' addition  to Dr. Watson's chronicle of the cases solved by Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "48 For those of us who love Sherlock and John, this hit the spot.  Good twists and surprises and intrigue over a nasty nasty nasty subject.\n",
      "49 Having just read the original Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and falling head over heels in love with them, I was ready for more, but was also a tad skeptical about the ability for any SH pastiches to live up the original stories.  Fortunately I found \"House of Silk\", and was pleasantly surprised - it's very well written and kept my attention throughout. I would love to read more adventures of Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson from Mr. Holowitz in the near future!\n",
      "50 Writing a Holmes book of this caliber is no small task. I have read the complete works by Sir Doyle, and House of Silk compairs remarkably well. Congratulations on a job well done, Mr. Horowitz.\n",
      "51 I have been a fan of Doyle and Holmes since I was a teenager and first picked up the Canon and read it for myself. I could actually persuade myself that I was only reading the last of Doyles tales of the great detective when I started in on Anthony Horowitz's book \"The House of Silk.\" Commissioned by the family of Sir Arthur, he captured quite wonderfully the essence of the time period, the people who lived in it and most importantly Watson's style of narration, although this tale is much darker than any before it. A truly excellent read, hard to put down until the very last page.\n",
      "52 Between the writer and the fact that the Conan Doyle family had put their approval on this manuscript, I expected better. The story line began well enough but ended poorly. I was very disappointed. I'm a huge Conan Doyle fan, began reading his Sherlock Holmes stories in the late 50s, and was thrilled to read the background of how this book came about. I am also a big Foyle's War fan so, how could THE HOUSE OF SILK be anything but a well-written story? Unfortunately,  it's not.\n",
      "53 being a major fan of christie, connan doyle and other great british crime novelists, i had major expectations from this piece. especially given the rest of horowitz's oeuvre (foyle, barnaby, and many tv adaptations of marple and poirot). i am happy to say i enjoyed every page of the book: read it twice, with equal pleasure, first for the sheer fun of whodunnit, and second time to appreciate the clever prose. thank you, mr. horowitz, for such a wonderful time. i recommend the book to any and all lovers of british-style mystery.\n",
      "54 This book surpassed my expectations from use/description of the voices and mannerisms of Holmes and Watson. The inter-related stories created suspense not confusion as a lesser quality New Release of a Sherlock Holmes mystery. Bravo.\n",
      "55 At age 40 I didn't expect to take a sudden liking to ACD's works; but I've seriously enjoyed the tales of his famous detective.  Since I started reading them, I've also enjoyed many of the TV and Movies adaptations; however, nothing compares to sitting quietly and reading Watson's descriptions of how SH's brilliant mind works.\n",
      "56 I like the twists and turns of Sherlock Holmes stories.  This group of short stories involves some of the most intricate cases I have come across.  however, a couple of them seemed like a rewrite of older stories.  All told,a very enjoyable read.\n",
      "57 Nice. Follow the adventures of Sherlock holmes like the blue carbuncle and others. Thoroughly enjoyed it.\n",
      "58 Lots of twists and turns from start to end, just as one might expect in a Holmes story. I thought he captured the spirit of Conan Doyle brilliantly.  I'm good at figuring out mysteries and I'd tumble to the outcome until it unfolded. A great read too!\n",
      "59 If you’re a fan of Sherlock Holmes you will find this a worthy continuation of his adventures. Horowitz has done an excellent job of positioning the story in the right time and, of course, the right narrative of Dr. Watson. You’ll not be disappointed.\n",
      "60 I'm familiar with Horowitz from his creative efforts on Foyle's War for PBS (a favorite program of mind), so understood at least one reason why he was chosen to write this book. It felt as though I was reconnecting with my old friend Dr. Watson, after not visiting with him for a good many years. I admit that at first I was focused on the writing (would Horowitz achieve what he intended), but it didn't take long for me to shift gears and become fully engaged in the story. Horowitz's writing gave me no choice. Excellent job!\n",
      "61 This is a Sherlock Holmes mystery, the first time that the Conan Doyle Estate has authorized a new novel. Anthony Horowitz does a fabulous job following in those elusive footsteps of Conan Doyle. I love the ramblings of Dr. John Watson, and his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. Due to the nature of the investigation, Holmes brings his brother, Mycroft, into the case. Poor Watson, did not even know of the existence of Mycroft. After watching many of the PBS programs, I can imagine this book as a presentation. The Sherlock Holmes novels are interesting in the detective work and the development of theories.\n",
      "62 Anthony Horowitz has accomplished the nearly impossible task of both capturing Arthur Conan Doyle’s style and constructing a devilishly complex plot worthy of the best of Sherlock Holmes. This is a wonderfully enjoyable read. You owe it to yourself to give it a whirl.\n",
      "63 A Great Sherlock! And I should know, see my name! This author has done his research and he know his Arthur Conan Doyle. The language and setting are both authentic. So is Dr. Watson's narrative voice. The story? It's simply a superb Sherlock mystery! Hoping Anthony Horowitz writes more.\n",
      "64 If you loved the original Sherlock stories than you will thoroughly enjoy this book.  In every discernible way Horowitz has captured the essence of Sherlock, Watson and turn of the century London.  There were plenty of plot twists, red herrings and head-scratchers to keep you on the edge of your seat.  In sum it was a terrific read that I highly recommend.\n",
      "65 Anthony Horowitz approaches Holmes' world with great respect for what has been crafted by Doyle. This VERY clever and absorbing story fits in with the cannon without being merely derivative. Watson is at his best as he reflects back on this case, his tongue now being freed as certain of those involved are no longer living. I will give no spoilers, nor will I reveal the plot here. You are reading this because you are hungry for another Holmes adventure. You have found it.\n",
      "66 I've always enjoyed the stories of Holmes and Watson, and this set did not disappoint. I'm sure any Holmes reader will feel the same.\n",

      "0 All accessories were missing in this book. That’s half the fun. Description clearly states that it comes with the accessories or I would never have bought! Infuriating. Also outside of book was beat up and covered in filth?\n",
      "1 I bought this Nook to read library ebooks on, however, I extremely dislike the fact that I have to connect the device to my computer and use Adobe Digital Editions in order to do so. On top of that, I have gotten numerous errors when trying to access ebooks on this device in spite of following the directions to a T. At this point, I am limited to only using the Nook when I can afford to purchase an ebook through Barnes & Noble (as a librarian, I feel like BUYING ebooks is a HUGE waste of money). Kindles are SO much easier to use (I have two older models and have never had any trouble with them aside from wanting a built-in light). I regret not purchasing a Kindle Paperwhite (which has a built-in backlight) instead of this Nook with GlowLight :(\n",
      "2 I needed to replace my Nook and debated buying a new model or THIS model that I've been loving for 3 years.  If you want an e-reader this is your Nook!  It's black and  white display is great for books.\n",
      "3 This is replacing my Nook first edition (which in my opinion, is the best version by far) and while I like the size and feel of it, the operation leaves something to be desired. Page turns are not instantaneous and there is a weird, albeit brief flash of the screen every time I change pages. The page turn is actually faster on my first edition. I was also having issues with some books where I received an error when I tried to turn the page, almost like the page didn't exist. I would have to reset my nook, used the \"Go To\" function to skip to the page AFTER the one I wanted to read, and then go back a page just to pick up where I left off. And BN customer service is completely unhelpful when it comes to their slightly older e-readers, because everybody wants you to upgrade to their newest tablet editions with backlit screens. If I wanted to read books on a tablet, I would do that, but what I want is an e-ink ereader specifically for reading books. I have been a nook fan since the beginning and I still totally am. I really want to love this, but until BN works out their software issues, I just can't.\n",
      "4 While I do love my Kindle, it can't do everything. For instance, borrowing ebooks via my local library is a no-go if I want to read them on my Kindle. So, with that and other reasons in mind, I looked for something cheap and reliable to read epub files. I might have gone with the Kobo, but found the prices exorbitant--particularly on Amazon. So a used Nook it is and in the week or so I've been trying it out, it works just as well as I had hoped. In fact, the touch screen that allows swiping through the pages is a nice little feature that my humble Kindle just can't do.\n",
      "5 I love the Nook, so sad that they aren't doing well. I think the E-ink is great, I can't stand reading on my ipad, the blue light sucks. I think this glow is nice and soft enough to read before bed. The switching between pages does get a little jarring to most people. I got use to it.\n",
      "6 The cost of this product with the fact of limited use its only black and white its like getting a news paper as apposed to instant news information from a app. Its more expensive once the initial cost of the device for the electronic downloadable books. The free selection of books is limited. The local library has more free books and up to date than this device has.\n",
      "7 Bought this for my son for Christmas.  He had the Nook Color and didn't like the fact that the battery drained so quickly.  He only used it for reading and uses his computer for internet and gaming so this Nook was all he needed.  He loves it and has been able to keep it charged for much longer periods.\n",
      "8 I bought this reader as a back up when I'm going on trips and will read outside in the sun. I normally use my Xoom tablet with the BN app. but sunlight is not your friend. This one is perfect for it AND I like have the light for when it's a little darker in a room\n",
      "9 it's outstanding for books. PDF's are good. i wish i could find some way to put song lyrics on it. This isn't a complaint, i just can't figure out a good way to do it.\n",
      "10 The item is very complicated to use if you want to download public library books. quite an ordeal . you need first to get an adobe program then download book to computer etc. What is most objectionable is the pricing by amazon. The item is listed at $219 retail sold at amazon for $72 at a considerable markdown making it sound very attractive . Yet at Band N if you walk in, the same Nook is priced at $79 and you get a $20 gift card if you buy one . So there is something deceptive if not downright dishonest in the way the item is advertised at Amazon..\n",
      "11 This reader is almost iconic - there is nothing to compare with the readability, battery life and format compatibility. I purchased this to replace the exact same model that I have been using for nearly 10 years, and I'll be sad when I can't replace it again.\n",
      "12 I wanted to buy an e-book and decided on a nook. Broke in 3 months. NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. I tried to get support and the company refused to help me. Evidentally, there are screen problems with the Nooks. I did research and alot of other people had that same problem. Getting support for it is even worse. Don't bother with it. Go with a Kindle or a Sony.\n",
      "13 This arrived as described, packaged well, and worked well. The only issue I have ever had with them is its not as user friendly as it could be. I had to go to online blogs to find the rest of the steps to download an eBook. Whether it was from Barnes and Noble or the library.\n",
      "14 In my opinion, this is the best e book.  I am so frustrated with the new version since they don't have sd card expansion although still prefer it over Kindle\n",
      "15 Great for novels, not so great for non-fiction with photos and charts.  Does almost everything well. Compact, keeps a charge for 30 days or so.  The feel of it, the look of it.  It is special.\n",
      "16 I purchased this book on my Kindle and got about two or three pages into it and noticed that something was terribly wrong with the English. It reads like a bad translation from another language. And that's not because' it's Victorian-era British English. As the original Sherlock Holmes books by Arthur Conan Doyle are in the public domain, their texts are everywhere on the Internet. I just wanted to read this on my Kindle and was willing to pay the $3.99 to do so.\n",
      "17 It is a frustrating read. Some stories are incomplete. Other stories are duplicated. A very poor job done by the editor.\n",
      "18 I would rate this a ZERO if I could. Do not buy this edition as it reads like it was typeset by a seven year old and no editor ever saw it after. I spent so much time trying to decipher the typos, double words, bizarre syntax, and gobbledy gook english that I had to shelve it. It was cheap, but Amazon should be ashamed to sell a book as bad as this.\n",
      "19 As someone before has stated, there are several technical glitches throughout the book, for example in the signature of the letter of the first story, in the word \"employee\" as well as in place of (money) values in the second story.. (and that is as far as I have gotten so far). It is highly annoying. I am merely reading the kindle version as a means to pass the time while I wait for a different, annotated version in print to come from the library; I also have another electronic version I can consult every time I come across a glitch of unintelligible symbols (I hate not knowing what they intend to say).\n",
      "20 This item was new but failed to turn on after fully charged.  We have used e-readers for years and this is the first one with this problem.\n",
      "21 This audiobook version sucks! You get what you pay for - janky, staticky reading of the book without accent. The audio isn't automatically downloaded with the book; you have to go to a whole other website in order to listen to it, which of course they don't tell you how to do. It was the Amazon Kindle customer service team that helped with this part.\n",
      "22 Had it for almost a month and it's still incredible. I don't even read lol but this thing makes me want to. The screen resolution is a little low but unless you're comparing it to a higher res screen you can barely notice it.\n",
      "23 The most frustrating, unreliable electronic I have ever owned. Within the first month, I started having trouble with the touchscreen and I continue to every time I use it. No matter how many times I wipe it, clean it, dust it - it won't respond, will respond for a few seconds or will work for a few minutes. And, there is no other way to operate the device. I hate it.\n",
      "24 I wanted a long lasting tablet to read books and it works great!  I would like to have a back light but I did not think the light was worth the money.\n",
      "25 Fun read. Kindle edition is OK except for foreign symbols are messed up (currency, some words). Currency amounts can be an important detail in these stories, so this leaves a bit of a hole in the narrative. And disrupts the flow.\n",
      "26 Everything you'd expect is in here. Actually I did have some problems with the illustrations, some are cropped wrong so parts of the illustrations is cut off, or at very slightly skewed angles, or with double prints. It might have just been that I had an old style Kindle that couldn't process them, but it was a bit disappointing.  The text and stories are formatted well. The only thing I'd want was some footnotes that explain some archaic terms that pop up on occasion that aren't really in the dictionary, luckily I have a footnoted print version.\n",
      "27 Purchased the NOOK Touch e-reader for my daughter for Christmas. We were not too happy with it so for a few dollars more she upgraded to the NOOK notebook. There are many more options offered...although I wasn't aware that a lot of the apps are not free ones. For the money, though, it is a better buy. She loves it. Also, Barnes and Noble is wonderful at Tech Support. They helped her get it all set up!\n",
      "28 You bump these the slightest little bit and the screen will stop working.\n",
      "29 is nice but is not complete, the pdf reading is reeeeally bad but if you root it, that is hacking and use android on it is a great product.\n",
      "30 I replaced a three year old Sony e-reader with this Nook because the Sony has a software problem that stops functioning and requires a re-boot every day or two and to acquire the GlowLight. The most annoying feature is a lack of available font  sizes on the Nook (making text either too small or too large) and it has only one dictionary. The Sony has 11 versions/languages, French-German-Spanish, etc; and a full functioning Browser. I would have consider an updated Sony if I had been aware of the text limitations, as it is now I go back to using the Sony on those books that do not display in a proper size.\n",
      "31 Spent an entire day trying to set up the device to download books from my library.  Library was very helpful but B&N tech support is outsourced and very, very difficult to work with and hard to understand.  I finally, after 4 calls, asked to speak to a supervisor who worked for over an hour to clean up the nook issues.\n",
      "32 The screen is damaged just after a year. I should have read more reviews on nooks.\n",
      "33 The book is amazing - I will be purchasing this book in hardback soon. With that said the Kindle book is lacking. As I read through the book there are several typos. I don't know if they were missed in translation or if the Kindle reader on my phone has a glitch but when I checked it on my wife's phone it had the same issue. Seems through out the book every time a unit of measure is used (such as the lb sterling symbol) the translator screwed up and just stuck in a bunch of symbols. I really do hope that someone spends some time on this and can fix it. I know that this is enough reason for me to stick with my page turning. Thank you for the great download and good luck with the fix.\n",
      "34 After having this for a couple of months, I picked it up one morning and the ink or whatever it is inside was slushy and blobby. Couldn't read on it anymore. Sooooo back to reg books. Not spending this kind of money again to have it go bust.\n",
      "35 The e-ink background is so much nicer for reading books than back-lit tablets.  This is my second Nook Simple Touch reader and I will be disappointed when I can no longer buy this product.\n",
      "36 yet again another software product that is poorly designed.  The basic functionality is not intuitive and the 'light' was dim and the reading pane was dull and lifeless.  The whole thing feels acts cheap.  I really wonder if the Executives at B&N actually use their products???? Who is doing human-machine usability?  Bad experience all in all...\n",
      "37 All of the bad reviews for this poor device got me a little worried about getting it.  Let me clear things up.  The guy who said you can't delete books from the nook is TOTALLY wrong.  In your library, all you have to do is double tap the book and hit archive.  And to people who say it can't do as many things as it should, it's an EREADER.  eREADERS are for reading.  If you want to listen to music, get an iPod.  Last time I checked iPod shuffles are like 50 dollars.  Trust me, I'm a musician and i love music too, but the nook without music is fine.  The same thing goes for games.  You get an ereader to read, not to play games.  iPads, iPhones, and iPod touches a great for games.  I have a nook and an ipod, an im surviving.  Now the only other bad thing I've really heard is that the glowlight hassle elope tears and holes in it.  I've only had mine for a few days so I can't say whether or not that will happen.  So far, it hasn't.\n",
      "38 I've read \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" in a number of formats including paperbacks and a much beloved two volume annotated edition of all of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories and novels in chronological order. In spite of the price this version for the Kindle was a bit disappointing. A huge problem for me was that every time a sum of money was mentioned it was difficult, and sometimes impossible, to determine the correct amount because either there wasn't a symbol for Pounds available or it just didn't transfer properly when it was prepared for the ebook format. It felt as though it was scanned with character recognition software that couldn't read the symbol for Pounds Sterling.\n",
      "39 My Kindle broke and I replaced it with an extremely cheap Nook.  Since then I have been extremely disappointed.  I only expect three things out of an e-reader and was shocked to learn that the Nook fails on two of the three counts.\n",
      "40 I waited a while and was very hesitant to buy this because of all of the negative reviews about the screen problems.  I have a lot of Nook books which I have been reading on the Ipad Mini but I do a lot of my reading at night and the backlight is too harsh for my eyes after working at a computer all day.  I finally decided to take the chance and purchased the Nook Glowlight.  I've had it for three weeks now and so far so good - though there is a little tiny pin hole on the screen.  I had asked the customer service person at BN about the problem and she said it was just a bad batch early on and the problem was fixed.  We'll see.  I did purchase the extended warranty just in case and figured if the screen does fail I'll just give up and use a clip on light.  I like the Nook.  I like the size, the feel and the page turn buttons.  I really hope this device holds up.  It deserves to have a good following - but BN needs to step up and commit to solving whatever is wrong.  If their devices are not selling well it's because they are lagging behind in the solutions and they are only hurting themselves.\n",
      "41 Got mine for a considerably cheaper price but it *still* wasn't worth what I paid UNTIL I rooted it. It is far more cheaply constructed than the Kindle and the glow isn't nearly as effective as the Paperwhite. It's native software makes it (virtually) impossible to take advantage of the extra storage and its stock fonts make the screen far more difficult to read than need be.\n",
      "42 A little less than two years ago I got my mother a keyboard Kindle.  Her eyesight has deteriorated to the point that the black on gray background of the Kindle is not easy for her to read.  And the rocker to move the cursor is not easy for her.  Since reading the Bible is important to her, she needs a set up that allows easy access to chapters in a big, complex book.\n",
      "43 Two major issues with the Nook Glowlight Plus make this e reader only a two star item. Most annoying is that the book I am reading closes without my doing anything other than reading. I am not touching anything, it just reverts to the home page. This happens so often (sometimes every minute or two) it makes reading really frustrating. I have to keep hitting the book symbol in upper left corner to go back to the page.\n",
      "44 So frustrated with these things - 3 kids, 3 Nooks, 4 exchanges so far because of the \"ripped\" GlowLight screen. The first return/exchange was within a week of owning them, very light use. The others followed soon after. The kids loved them so we kept them even after the \"rips\" reappeared, but now one of them has just completely died (the Nook is 10 months old). Half the screen is garbled and the other half is stuck on one of the author screen savers.\n",
      "45 I have or have had an iPad 3, Kindle Fire (original), and the 1st generation Nook. I love my iPad but I see it more of a mini laptop and like it for web browsing and certain apps. I thought the Kindle Fire was great for the price but didn't really need it and an iPad; plus I didn't like reading on it since its more like a computer screen. I liked the 1st generation Nook but it was heavier, bigger, and didnt have the improvements of the newer versions like the built-in glowlight.\n",
      "46 Touch screen does not work if slightly warmed by the sun. The scrolling buttons do not always work and sometimes is stuck. The plastic has degraded completely after several years with almost no usage. It is just a low quality Chinese crap.\n",
      "47 I have changed my review of this product from 5 stars to 0 stars. I was in love with this thing at one point in time. However, it has a horrible defect that I just cannot live with. If you sideload your books (add your own books to a memory card instead of purchasing from Barnes and Noble), everytime you turn the device completely off and on (like in the event of it freezing, like mine's has done more than once) all of your shelves (like collections on Kindle) will erase. Disappear, your shelves are empty. It also happens if you disconnect your Nook from your Macbook the wrong way.\n",
      "48 We bought one of these for my mother-in-law hoping to get her a piece of technology that would be enjoyable for her to use. It has been nothing but a pain. Her main thing she uses it for is reading books from the library. This requires a process that involves going through hoops, a computer, and an Adobe ID and software. Having experience with an Amazon Kindle (the very basic one) and iPads with library books, this was an absolute pain and I feel bad for my in-laws. What should be a two-five step process is way more complex and requires special software on the computer to transfer the ebook to the nook. There have been several occasions where my father-in-law (who is ok with technology) has called up and spent hours on the phone with my husband trying to figure out how to get a book onto the nook.\n",
      "49 I have had three replacements!!!  You have to drag your fingers across the screen to turn the device on.\n",
      "50 If your idea of a good time is spending hours trying to get your computer to recognize it, and spending hours on help boards etc this is the device for you. For any sane individual it's clearly a pig in a poke.\n",
      "51 It does what it promised, but there's a learning curve and it doesn't respond well to my fat fingers. Light is good. Good for the recipient (a gift) but I don't want one.\n",
      "52 I thought this was a good buy and honestly it did work well for awhile.  BUT...after a couple months of use -- the screen NO LONGER responds to my touch, I can literally tap tap tap tap and nothing will happen, it's completely unresposive - heck it won't even power off because it won't respond to my touch anymore.  And the screen freezes A LOT!  So be careful with this, if you plan on using this long term I would definitely reccommend AGAINST it.  I had one of the original nooks that came out and that worked so much better than this.  Definitely disappointed.  WIll probably be looking inot getting a Kindle.\n",

      "13 I was going to deploy to my third deployment to Iraq in 2011 and I wanted some way to read all my books. As you may know, space is precious when you're talking about military gear. We were very strict on what we could or could not bring on the deployment. Also I need something that could go a long time on a single charge. None of the full tablets were going to cut it and than I discovered the paper white. It claims that you can go several weeks on a single charge (or was it months) I can't remember since it's been son long. There were times on my last deployments where we went almost a month without any electricity. After a successful deployment I can defiantly say that this nook proved it was up to the task. I don't think I charged it more than twice and the second charge was just because I had the time and means. The tablet was also very well built. As you may know, Iraq has lots of sand. There were even a few times where I dropped the tablet in the sand. The device kept on trucking and did not give up.\n",

      "36 This edition (Bed Book)'s format is very different from 'traditional' books - it is in landscape format, meaning while the title page is vertical (like with most books), the printing inside is landscape. It claims to be good for readers confined to their beds or people who prefer to read in bed. I didn't know this before buying the book, and I must say it's a bit weird to me. I don't usually read in bed so I don't see how it is a superior or revolutionary format. I didn't find such a description about this before purchasing, or I wouldn't have bought it. It's not necessarily bad, just not suitable for me.\n",

When reading a book a nice feature is being able to highlight a word and have a dictionary definition pop up. But again this functions only some of the time. Another nice feature is book marking a page...again works only occasionally. When I bought it it was the highest rated dedicated e-reader but I have been disappointed in its functionality. Another sore point...B & N current ebooks are constantly more expensive than Amazon's. (The do have some amazing older books (public domain) that have been digitized and are free.)\n",

      "0 I can't get over this book, I read it in one day.  Never have I read a book like this, it just captivated me.  The authors mother was just fanatastic keeping her family together while being forced to walk to a concentration camp, and then making sure they survived the time in camp.  At first I felt bad when the author married a man she really didn't seem to love, but after seeing how she treated him during almost 30 years of marriage I felt rather angry at her.  On the other hand, how hard it must be to lose your first love and never know if he survived the war.  In the end I was very glad she stayed with her husband.  I think so many of the problems with the author and her husband was the fact that they never really dealt with living through the Holocaust and were both keeping big secrets from each other.  I'm so very glad I got to read this book.\n",

Sixty years can color a lot of memories, and since she allowed those memories to put her life on a self induced hold which kept her from moving on with her life, she comes across as quite self-centered and manipulative.  While growing up in Budapest prior to Hitler's invasion, she falls in love with Richie, another Hungarian Jew. Their love is, in her eyes, is of what fairy tales are made. Unfortunately she, her mother, brother, and sister are forced by the Nazis to become part of the death march from Budapest to Vienna. Richie is sent to a different work camp. That part of her story is heart wrenching, but she allows the telling of her love story with Richie to overshadow the horror of Mauthausen, the concentration camp from which she is eventually liberated. The obsession with finding Richie and then dwelling on how miserable she had been throughout her most of her adult life with Otto, her husband, overshadowed the memoir for me. For me she came to be an unreliable narrator of the love affair with Richie and her say in the concentration camp. It seemed to me that the camp should have been more devastating and  more of an obstacle to a happy, self fulfilled life than dreaming of a lost Richie especially when Otto treated her like a princess. After my book club discussed it, several of us wondered what her purpose was in writing the book in the first place.\n",
      "4 The book was a fantastic read.  However, I was disappointed how it ended.  Rather than taunt and lie to Richie, why didn't she just leave him alone at the restaurant?  If only Richie had hung around the apartment in New York following Otto's denial that Betty lived there.  He would no doubt have seen her come and go into the apartment within hours.  So sad for Richie.\n",
      "5 How this woman manages to make a rational decision in the midst of an emotional upheaval of the most incredible proportions is beyond my comprehension. It would be like deciding the safest path to choose while  running down an erupting volcano...\n",
      "6 First let me say that I have read countless survivor books. Because of this I have a good idea of what to expect when I pick up the next one. Although everyone certainly has their unique tale, there are some things that are consistent within all of them. The horrific treatment the Jews of Europe were subjected to during the 30's and 40's is not to be discounted. In fact it was so horrendous that I have continued to read each and every story I come across hoping to somehow find an answer for why this tragedy occurred. Of course there is no answer other then in every man is the ability to be evil. Hitler's Europe certainly proved this to be true.\n",
      "7 I really liked the synopsis of this book when I purchased it and couldn't wait to read it. And almost the entire way through, I did enjoy it. As the story went on, I began to like Amelia less and less and she was pushed towards being a little unrealistic. However, I felt that Matthew's character changed as well and not necessarily for the better. The argument, however, can be made that Amelia made him this way. Besides that, I enjoyed the characters and the story. But, I was supremely disappointed in the ending. I purchased this on my Kindle so I was keeping an eye on how much of the book I had left. Just when I thought everything was getting very good, I hit the 75% mark on my Kindle and the book was over!! The last 25% of it was acknowledgements and a sample of another Lisa Tucker book. I was so disappointed. There was so much more that could have happened and it just ended.\n",
      "8 Lisa Tucker's latest novel, THE CURE FOR MODERN LIFE, forces us to consider what it means to be a good person in today's social, political and spiritual climate.  Matthew, an executive of a pharmaceutical company, comes face to face with hard questions of morality when he meets, Danny, on a bridge one night.  Should he ignore the ten-year-old's cry for help?  Should he turn away from the small homeless and motherless (his mother is a drug addict) boy and his three-year-old sister on the cold Philadelphia night? Matthew agrees to let Danny and his sister, as well as Danny's mother stay with him in his Philadelphia loft.  Amelia, Matthew's ex and a medical ethicist, comes back into his life.  What happens next is a \"battle\" between Matthew, Amelia, and Danny's wants and desires.  The question remains is there a winner at the expense of the other two? Or is there a way to live with the compromise?  You'll have to read and find out.\n",
      "9 Tucker offers a cure for modern readers seeking an enjoyable literary page-turner that also explores serious social issues such as addiction, ethics and genetics. Tucker's fourth and most ambitious novel (following Once Upon a Day) is her first to have a male protagonist.\n",
      "10 This is an interesting and entertaining, if implausible, book about ethics, and the personal and professional choices of a pharmaceutical VP, an ethicist, a scientist and a homeless kid.\n",
      "11 Lisa Tucker prefaces her novel with a quote from Dr. Seuss, which emphasizes the requirement to care a great deal in order to make the world a better place. It's a poignant stage curtain to open on this story which begins with a high-powered executive's opportunity to brush off a ten-year-old homeless boy and his three-year old sister.\n",
      "12 That's the first sentence of THE CURE FOR MODERN LIFE: \"Was Matthew Connelly a bad man?\" It is promptly followed by, \"He'd never once asked himself that question.\" Will he by the book's conclusion?\n",
      "13 This of course is very personal but three quarters of the way through i found i didn't like the protaganist much. This is not to diminish the tragedy and suffering of her and her family of course\n",
      "14 I enjoyed this book despite the unhappy parts in it.  The story has the ending it should have.  I won't reveal it.\n",
      "15 Parts of the plot defy belief, and one of the characters (Amelia) is so self-righteous and judgmental I often wanted to smack her on the head, but despite these minor flaws, The Cure for Modern Life is a totally captivating book. The characters seem real and alive--flawed people trying to do their best in difficult and unusual circumstances. And while they find that there's no cure for modern life, and obstacles keep sending you off-course from where you planned to go, sometimes, if you get lucky, you might end up where you belong anyway.\n",
      "16 In Philadelphia they were young and in love with plans. Now they have  become enemy combatants.  Amelia Johannsen has devoted her life to helping the poor; while business executive Matthew Connelly has devoted his life to making money.\n",
      "17 I enjoyed this book but I am not sure I would recommend in that sometimes things are good but you can still do without - if that makes sense.  Admittedly, it's a page turner, you start off wondering where it's all going to go from here and I can't say I was ever bored and wanted to skip to the end... but maybe it's because it's such an implausible scenario that I just have a hard time saying \"you must read this book.\"  But then perhaps I am biased - Amelia was very human and yet I did not like her character one bit!\n",
      "18 I listened all the way through in the hope that the book would redeem itself, but throughout I found it difficult to care about these people. One too many stories about the evils of Big Pharma, I guess. At any rate, I found there were a few too many coincidences holding a thin plot together, and not enough character development or descriptive depth to really fire my imagination.\n",
      "19 I lept into this book, anxious to see where it would lead, but ultimately I feel disappointed.  The plot is a too complicated and frankly, unbelieveable.  I also thought there were a few loose ends that were not resolved.  The themes are terribly over-stated.  Amelia's constant shifting affection between Ben and Matthew grew tedious.  I guess we were supposed to just figure it was the hormones.  What an insult!\n",
      "20 A friend thought I would like Lisa Tucker so I slogged through the whole book, hoping it would get better. From the beginning it was unrealistic, with implausible situations, too many convenient coincidences, and poorly developed, one-dimensional characters.  I could see the ending from early in the book. Reading this was a waste of time. I probably won't be buying any other of Tucker's novels.\n",
      "21 I could not believe this was the same author honestly. This book was so far fetched, predictable and sappy. I am glad I got from the library and did not invest any money in it. I hardly believe anyone has the power to get free rehab for a complete stranger at a pricey posh place. Letting two homeless kids live in your apartment and then end up with custody of them after all that? And then getting your ex girlfriend back with the generous gift of your best friends baby she is carrying? Ridiculous, really. Yes, fiction should take us away from real life, but this was just silly in my opinion.\n",
      "22 Lately things haven't been good for Cathy. Her father died, her boyfriend dumped her, and her grades aren't so hot. While she can't do anything about her dad and doesn't really want to do anything about her grades, she is determined to figure out why her boyfriend dumped her and why in the world she has a needle mark on the inside of her arm when she comes home from his house. From the moment she decides to search out Victor and learn his secrets, she is swept up into a mystery involving some shady characters and business. Not only does Cathy have to deal with this weirded out mystery she's gotten herself into, but there's her moody mom and her best friend who's having some problems of her own. In her journal Cathy retells her hilarious tales and takes a twisting journey to solve the mystery that every girl wants to know. Why did my boyfriend breakup with me?\n",
      "23 Cathy's boyfriend, Victor, unexpectedly breaks up with her and Cathy is not handling it well.  Two days prior to their breakup, she woke up after an evening with Victor in which her memories remain fuzzy with a mark on her arm that looks like a needle track.  Cathy isn't one to just sit back and take this, regardless of what her best friend Emma thinks, and soon she finds herself deeply involved in a complex puzzle with a murder, a biotech company, and some really scary men in Chinatown.  What dark secrets will be revealed in CATHY'S BOOK?\n",
      "24 Cathy's Book is a most interesting little idea; written in journal form, it follows Cathy (naturally) as she tries to find out why her boyfriend, Victor, has suddenly dumped her.  Sounds like a run of the mill story, right?  Wrong.  Deciding to investigate Victor, who is a few years older than the senior in high school, Cathy inadvertantly discovers that he is involved in something much, much bigger than she'd imagined and her life is suddenly in grave danger as she pursues the answers to the strange mystery of just what Victor is up to. Enlivening this journal are the doodles that Cathy continually makes around (and sometimes on top of ) the entries, and the packet of \"evidence\" secured inside the front cover.\n",
      "25 Cathy Vickers has had a tough year. Her dad passed away unexpectedly and her mom is always working weird shifts at the hospital. She's not doing great in school, but she did meet a nice guy, Victor, a Chinese-American man who, okay, might be a little too old for Cathy. But things were fine until Victor dumped her, and she woke up with a weird mark on her arm. Since he won't talk to her, Cathy has launched an investigation. Suddenly she's in over her head in the part of Chinatown you don't visit as a tourist. Just in case, Cathy is putting together a book of her her thoughts and some (stolen) evidence. It's for Emma, her best friend, and if Cathy goes missing, she can only hope what she's found can lead to the parties responsible. This is a well-planned novel, complete with interactive web components, phone numbers to call, and evidence to inspect. While at times far-fetched, the characters are sympathetic and intriguing enough to keep the reader hooked through to the twist ending. Definitely a series worth continuing.\n",
      "26 When hotheaded artist Cathy wakes to find a mysterious mark on the inside of her arm she doesn't worry all that much. She just, as anyone would, assumes its (at worse) a spider bite. But when she starts feeling as if time literally stands still around her and life is moving at a slow motion pace, she knows this isn't a spider bite. As much as she tries to deny it, Cathy faces reality that her now ex-boyfriend, Victor, may have something to do with it. Did he drug her so he could take advantage of her? Did he inject her with a strange, wildly infectious disease? What is Victor up to, and why did he involve her?\n",
      "27 Cathy's Book is an intriguing narrative about a 17 year old girl who's mixed up with a possibly dangerous older man. Stewart writes well and it shows. I'd guessed early on a few of the themes and wondered aloud (correctly) about the relationship of Victor to the man in the photo. Stewart carries the taught narrative to the triumphant end. I didn't mind the product placement. I felt Stewart and the artists interwove the placements as gracefully as they could. I didn't care much for Cathy. She was annoying through a lot of the story -- she grows up a little towards the end -- but the story itself helped me forget her character flaws a bit.\n",
      "28 In this Fiction/ fantasy, “ Cathys book” by Stewart Weisman brigg became out to be such a great, interesting, most mysterious book ever. A young teenage girl getting dumped by her boyfriend, who’s very mysterious with many cases, that has yet not been known by anyone but her and her best friend. Cathy an amazing artist like her father, yet weirdly drawing people older than what they already are makes her more interesting, she’s really crazy than what you will expect. Dead people here and there, mainly who kills them leaves us clueless.The authors ability to build tension and interest was great, I was amazed by how quickly things were done and how things quickly changed. How horrible they may get, yet really sweet. This book made me more mysterious than a baby already rich at an hr old. This book is unique with so many proof in it. I highly recommend to those who love fantasy and mysteries.\n",
      "29 \"Cathy's  Book\" is an interesting, great read! It is about a girl who is suddenly dumped by her boyfriend, Victor, after mysteriously fainting and waking up with a needle mark on her arm. The story follows her and her friend, Emma as they unfold the mystery of why her boyfriend dumped her and where this mysterious mark on her arm came from. As they get deeper and deeper into their investigation, they learn shocking things about Victor, and Cathy ends up suspecting that Victor is a murderer. That is only the main plot. If I were to write about all of the sub-plots, I'd have a good three of four paragraphs.\n",
      "30 I like this book. I like the story line, albeit the twist was... twisty and not what I signed up for. I was told the book was like Veronica Mars... it was more like Buffy meets Veronica. I wasn't in the mood for a fantasy book, but that's what I got.\n",
      "31 ‘’Cathy’s Book’’ by Stewart Weismen Brigg wasn’t what I expected it to be. I thought it would be a book full of suspense and action but it wasn’t. I didn’t like this book at all and it was very confusing to read at some points and also very boring. I’d rather chop my fingers one by one rather than reading the first 3 pages. The realism of the characters was okay, it wasn’t the best but it did not suck. He knew how to make the book vivid and realistic by involving real life crimes and things that occur in families. There wasn’t much characterization in the book but i don’t think it was enough, he did not use characterization effectively. The author’s ability to build suspense wasn’t the best, it was unbelieveable and terrible! He just made it more boring because nothing was ever suspenseful and or interesting. I personally did not like the book at all, I expected better.\n",
      "32 When Cathy's boyfriend seems to disappear, she finds herself in a whole heap of trouble. After breaking into his house, and finding an old picture of him with a wife and a child, she starts to question who he really is. Later, after she is kidnapped by some goons, she realizes that all is not what it seems. That's right, folks, her boyfriend is immortal.\n",
      "33 This book provides an irreverent take on the various mommy tribes we tend to encounter around the births of our children.  There's the earth-mothers who think breast feeding is the be all and end all, whipping their boobs out proudly in public without flinching; then there's the mothers who seem to be in perfect shape, radiating confidence and glamor within three months of giving birth, making the rest of us feel wholly inadequate; and then there's our heroine - caught between the two.  This book has a good plot and will make you feel better about your mommy insecurities whilst having some laughs along the way.  A recommended read for all of us who know we fall short of the ideals - and don't care!!!\n",
      "34 I'm not a Mummy, yummy or otherwise,  but I really enjoyed this.  If you like chick lit, especially Brit chick lit, you will enjoy reading about this new mother's conflict about her relationship, being a mother and the tug for her to go back to work.  Also, her attempt to fit in with the fashionable, size 2 new mothers.\n",
      "35 I really liked the book.  It shows how easy it is to let your mind run away from you and that you should ask instead of keeping it inside.  You just may have it wrong and boy do baby hormones not help.\n",
      "36 \"Nothing shakes one out of a shoe-centered singleton apolitical existence quite like a baby...\"\n",
      "37 Londoner Amy Crane becomes unexpectedly pregnant and then finds that pregnancy leaves her unexpectedly frumpy. Envying all the MILFs she encounters, she eventually starts on a self-improvement kick which has a negative effect on her love life. This book takes an honest look at what it's like to be home with a baby and a body you no longer recognize, suddenly cut off from friends and work. Amy's struggles with self-esteem will be familiar to many new moms and the self-acceptance and courage she finds will inspire many.\n",
      "38 As a not-very-yummy mummy of a toddler (never having found the time for pilates, or maintaining perfect highlights and manicures pre- or post-partum) I can't say I could entirely relate to this book, or to many of its characters. However, it is a light, fun, easy read that will get a few laughs - and will probably skim, if not actually strike, a chord with most mummies.\n",
      "39 I adore Polly Williams so I can forgive her for writing this book. I couldn't finish Yummy Mummy for one of a few reasons: one the story wasn't strong and secondly I didn't like the way the protagonist seemed to hate her baby.\n",
      "40 I like it so much. The only con I can mencione is I haven't find the zoom option for images.\n",
      "41 If you like a read that moves dart, this could be disappointing for there are long passages that are rather slow. If, however, you enjoy complex plots with rich characters and a glimpse of English life and countryside from over a century ago you'll like this for sure.\n",
      "42 Horowitz is a fine writer, imaginative and accomplished, and I fully enjoyed House of Silk as a Sherlock Holmes mystery (with a lot of Watson).  I dinged the rating one star for two reasons: there is a lot of unnecessary gore here, some involving children and animals - I don't care for that; two, without giving away any of the plot, the ending is soft and unconvincing, given the amount of power the bad guys demonstrated throughout the book. I recommend it, though.\n",
      "43 House of Silk takes to much time trying to imitate Sir Arthur's writing style, as if the author is trying to put every idiosyncrasy from a multitude of stories in to this one story.  This slows the pace of the book.  On top of that, Horowitz' Dr. Watson, gives 21st century attitudes and commentary on the 19th century London.  Sir Arthur just told the story, without political correctness clogging up the tale.  Thus, although the story can be interesting, it takes to long to get going and doesn't  keep momentum.  I usually finish a book within a few hours, or a few days, depending on how well written or exciting the book is.  I've been reading this one for a couple of months, coming back to it between other books.  I haven't given up on it because I do love Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson adventures and there is enough in this book to pay homage to the Baker Street duo but I wish it was a more compelling read.\n",
      "44 As others have pointed out, Horowitz is styling a 19th century work with a 21st century perspective. When a \"respectable\" character goes to prison, the character enjoys deference and respect that lower class criminal probably would not. But there are other instances where the perspective is oddly modern. To some degree, this is inevitable. There are incidents in Agatha Christie books that are cringingly racist, ans those works are far more recent than the original Sherlock Holmes stories. But I think the subject matter makes it worse.\n",
      "45 If this book were written like most Sherlock Holmes books it would have been a more interesting read. Watson give too much opinion, too many observations which gives away the climax before it happens. The editor should have made this a more concise read rather than letting it get bogged down in the details. Foreshadowing??? When does Watson ever foreshadow events.  It could have been a 5 star book- so disappointing:(\n",
      "46 While I was not a big fan of Anthony Horowitz's last Holmes outing, \"Moriarty\", which I found a bit too far from canon to be easily stomached (and both obvious and too focused on it's big \"McGuffin\" at the end), I found \"The House of Silk\" to be much more satisfying a story.  I was disappointed that I figured-out the entire plot - and *all* the salient facts about the crime and the criminals - just by reading the story itself as I went along: one of the best parts of a Holmes story is getting to the end and having Holmes lay out the facts for you, and finding-out how much smarter Holmes is than you are yourself.  In this case I had worked out everything very early on, which was a bit of a disappointment.  But still, a very acceptable story all together, and worth reading if you are an avid Holmes fan like myself.\n",
      "47 I really enjoyed this story. Some friends that know Sherlock much better than I do had mixed reviews. They had some issues regarding how Sherlock was portrayed and they felt it was not true to form. I thought it was a compelling storyline and being less of a Sherlock student meant I was blind to this.\n",
      "48 Solid mystery, moved along at decent pace, but I wasn't excited about this book. I don't want to give any spoilers away, so I have to keep my comments vague, but my big peeve was that the characters seemed very flat compared to the original stories, including some reactions to different situations that didn't seem in character at all to me. There was absolutely no purpose to an entire chapter where Watson encounters a famous name, except to have an appearance by that famous name in the book and that irked me. If you're looking for a good Sherlock Holmes Pastiche, read Laurie R King's 'Beekeeper's Apprentice' series or Lyndsay Faye's 'Dust and Shadow'.\n",
      "49 This book reads like the English translation of a Chinese product. Scam. No don't to buy, Buddy. WEIRD wording throughout.\n",
      "50 I like my Nook GlowLight, but do not like BN's current deceptive marketing of magazines by listing them within \"BN's Top 100.\"  It used to be convenient to use the 100 list to select books, now every other listing is a magazine rendering it useless for finding books.  This practice shows BN is not interested in serving my needs, rather it joins BN's marketing efforts with the shoddy, age old deceptive sales practices of the magazine industry, slipping them in under the radar within what appears to be a book list.  When it's time to replace my Nook, I doubt if I'll stay with a BN product for this reason.  Shame on BN!\n",
      "51 So what is the house of silk--an organization, an operation, a location; all of the above?  Sherlock Holmes is determined to find out, with the help of the now-married Dr. John Watson.  Horowitz's Watson is writing in retrospect, years after the case has been closed, for its nature was so horrid that the tale could not be told at that time.  The dust jacket notes describe the case as `too shocking, too monstrous, ever to appear in print . . . until now.'  While that is a bit hyperbolic, there is enough evil to go around and even (mini-SPOILER) a cameo appearance by our favorite mathematician and chemist, Professor James Moriarty, as well as an appearance by Holmes's obese brother, Mycroft.\n",
      "52 I felt that a few of the characters, Lestrade in particular, were portrayed badly, and not according to canon. Some aspects of the story felt anachronistic, and by the end, the story had developed an anti-Church antagonism. I was quite disappointed.\n",
      "Cluster #: 15\n",
      "0 It's a Nook, they are great! This one features a backlit screen which means you can read it in bed without keeping anyone awake. My only complaint is the clunky software to transfer books off a computer. I'm sure this has been remedied in newer versions, but aside from that this is a great alternative to a regular tablet which can bother some people's eyes from prolonged reading. The lack of glare is also very nice. Can't say that about your iPad when you try looking at it in any kind of sunlight!\n",
      "1 I love this Nook reader.  It is my first upgrade from the original Nook reader,  I love the glowlight. It makes it so much easier to read.  It is easy to use.  Although this is not the current glowlight reader, I feel that it is the better choice.  You have physical back and forward page buttons and a SD card slot which the current model lacks.  Although the new one supposedy has better screen resolution and a better glowlight, it is not noticeable to me.  Altogether, I feel that you get more bang for your buck with this model.  And, the included $5 B & N coupon is a nice little bonus.  The Nook reader was well packaged and quickly shipped.  I highly recommend this Nook and this seller.\n",
      "2 I bought this on the Black Friday Amazon sale, so I actually paid less than the normal price for a Simple Touch (without Glowlight). This somewhat kept my concerns about the screen fragility at bay - in order to avoid any disappointment, I managed to convince myself that I would be ok with a basic Simple Touch, if anything were to happen with the Glowlight function (such as the worryingly common \"hole in the screen\" problem).\n",
      "3 I loved the Nook with GlowLight when I first received it. It doesn't hurt my eyes when I read for hours, even in the dark with GlowLight on. But however, after 2 month, I noticed one of the pixel on the GlowLight \"broke.\" ( I have a screen protector & book sleeve with screen cover to protect it.) It still lights up, but it lights up brighter than the others. It is annoy when reading in dark lighting. When GlowLight is turned off, you cannot tell the one of the pixel is brighter than the other. Over all, it is a great e-reader.\n",
      "4 I really loved my Nook, and the reason I didn't rate it a five star, was the screen. I personally recomend you to purchase some sort of case to prevent any damage, Im doing an extreme care, but that didnt prevent enough, because my Nook got two little scratches in my first week, It doesnt bother when the GlowLight is off, in fact, its not even noticable. But when the GlowLight is on, it filters more light threw those scratches, which it is kinda bothering. So take care of it!\n",
      "5 You don't need a lamp to see and the light is adjustable.  You can extend battery life by using the light only when you need it and keeping it reduced to what you actually need for brightness.  If you want something other than a ebook reader then don't buy this product.  If you want to read an ebook, then I highly recommend this reader.\n",
      "6 I found tablets and phones lack the battery life and quiet simplicity of this type of specialised product.\n",
      "7 E-ink displays do not require a back light in order to display an image, this results in a less stressful experience for your eyes. Also, e-ink displays are easier to view in sunlight, this device is perfect for anyone that wants to read outdoors and have a large volume of books at your finger tips. These displays only use power to update the image on the display. Once the image has been updated, the display no longer consumes precious battery life. Meaning this device can actually last weeks/months on a single charge. The draw back is due to the update once scheme, the device may feel a bit sluggish to people use to tablets. This device was only designed as a reading device, therefore a quick response time should not be an issue.\n",
      "8 I am so glad that I got the reader with the glowlight as I like to read in bed before I go to sleep. I see lots if people with those clip on lights attached to their reader and it looks uncomfortable when they have to change position.  Grest nook reader.\n",
      "9 Need I say more?  Ok I will: The price is right.  If your primary goal is READING ACTUAL WORDS (What a thought!!!) then this e-reader is an excellent choice. The GlowLight is particularly helpful if reading in bed or in situations where the device is being backlit (such as sunlight through a window).\n",
      "10 Excellent used condition. Gave a 4/5 on the durability because this thing is fairly sturdy but I definitely recommend a case. Would be very easy to crush on accident. All in all, a good product, though. Very convenient when you're at the beach or camping and don't want to lug around a bunch of books.\n",
      "11 It's an excellent product. I would give it 5 stars except for the screen, which scratches way, way, way too easily. I scratched it twice on the first day of use. There's no reason a product like this should be super-sensitive.\n",
      "12 super device and saved my sanity during this time of stay in\n",
      "13 Need to clean the screen when the touchscreen stops responding - otherwise perfect.\n",
      "14 Excellent crisp E-ink, high contrast and resolution,\n",
      "15 It’s okay, just the touch screen is slow to respond.\n",
      "16 I got this used, rooted it, and am loving it. However, I recently got the one with glowlight, which is even better (I can now read in the dark in the same room as my sleeping children and husband--yay!), although I'm praying it doesn't develop the light 'holes' that I've read about.\n",
      "17 Love how simple it is also light weight and durable only down sides are you can't download the kindle app or any other apps and no back light making it more difficult to read if it had the back light and kindle app I'd definitely give it 5stars\n",
      "18 This reader is great it regular or bright environments and now that it has a back light it can be used in the dark as well.\n",
      "19 The battery only lasts a few hours\n",
      "20 This device does exactly what it is advertised as doing. The battery lasts for weeks, the storage is more than enough for a battery's worth of reading material. Be sure to keep it clean, or the interface will stop functioning.\n",
      "21 so much easier to read with the back light\n",
      "22 I feel bad saying I hate this product because when I first received it I absolutely loved it.  The quality of the GlowLight when used was spectacular, the features where easy to use.  Then tiny \"cracks / lines\" started to appear in the screen / light which made it difficult to use at first; then as more appeared the device became completely unusable.  This device was not abused in anyway. It was kept in a case, not dropped, etc..  After further searching concerning this problem, it is not uncommon.  A significant number of people reported the same problem even though their care of the device was good.  The most disturbing part of all this is that the manufacturer of the product has known about this problem and to date the item is still being sold with the defect.  I was so disappointed because other than this problem I loved my NOOK Simple Touch with GlowLight.  I now have a Kindle Paperwhite, it is similar to the Nook but just enough difference that except for the defect I like the Nook by a slight margin but not enough to invest in a defective product again.  In addition, there is difference between customer service for both devices. The Nook customer service regarding defects / returns / replacements is poor compared to the good reports of customer service with the Kindle.  Wanted to like the NOOK Simple Touch but couldn't risk it.\n",
      "23 The screen is very okay.  Not great, not terrible.  The lights are quite visible at the top of the screen, but the text is well lit.  The battery life is impressive, but the interface is clunky and awkward.\n",
      "24 Readability in Sunlight is super even when the sun is directly hitting the screen; can't be beat! The blacks are great and the contrasting white whites really helps these old eyes of mine! I like the Android operation too.\n",
      "25 I had been reading on an Ipad and was getting tired of the weight, changing pad from one hand to the other. The nook is so light, easy to navigate, and since I like to read all hours, I love the glow-light feature. I would definitely recommend this to others.\n",
      "26 I bought this because my older nook battery is slowing down, and I love the nook.  You cannot easily buy a new battery, but I could\n",
      "27 Kind of felt bad buying the competitors product on Amazon, but it's a great little device. Without the backlight, the battery lasts forever!\n",
      "28 Too many eReaders are trying to force us into tablets, but the Simple Touch is a great reader without having to pay for a full fledged tablet. The eInk screen is easy to read, even in direct sunlight, and the backlight makes reading in bed very easy. It also has a great battery life, even with the GlowLight.\n",
      "29 wanted it to used the glowlight and other electronic connections\n",
      "30 For the price I paid this was IMO a steal. I have ~60 books on it. The battery life is excellent and it's viewable even in the brightest sunlight.\n",
      "31 Much better than old Nook: longer battery life, lighter, good touch screen, easy to change settings. Text rotation would be a nice feature.\n",
      "32 She loves it, great battery life, fast page turn, great light feature for night reading, it is very light, I'm jealous I want one now lol.\n",
      "33 It's a solid e-reader with an amazing battery life, but the screen broke under very little pressure inside of a backpack, wrapped in a jacket, on a flight. So disappointing.\n",
      "34 The glowlight is perfect for all of us night readers! And if you can dim the the glow, or turn it off as you desire.\n",
      "35 It reads OK, but the battery life is dismal if I use the glowlite.\n",
      "36 I loved the glow light feature and I also love the anti glare for when you are sitting in the sun by the pool. The battery power lasted for our week of vacation too.\n",
      "37 Wish the screen were a bit brighter & that current books were available for less. It works great though and I'm looking forward to leaving heavy hardback books at home.\n",
      "38 The nook's glowlight for night reading is awesome however the memory is rather limited hence memory chip has to be utilized.\n",
      "39 Looks great, but it flashed more than normal when switching screens. It might be getting better, but I'm not sure. I owned a previous nook so I know how much is normal\n",
      "40 Controls not intuitive, but has good battery life. Wish I could have afforded the backlit one.\n",
      "41 My wife uses it everyday and she loves it. Plugging to charge is a chore with such tight delicate microUSB.\n",
      "42 Awesome reader with very long battery life. Charged twice in the last 6 months. Very pleased with this product. Thank you!!\n",
      "43 Everything is right about this little reader! We use iPads for everyday computing needs but even the iPads have a huge disadvantage when compared to this glow light model - battery life. Traveling or just around the house our iPads must be charged every night, often, it takes several hours. I can read with a glow light for a month before recharging. This simple little reader has earned a  ***** rating from me.\n",
      "44 Received with back light cracked.  Produced bright light lines when used.\n",
      "45 Too fragile,  a similar Kindle is a little bit more expensibe but much better device, I recommend  Kindle without any doubt\n",
      "46 I have had my Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight for two years now. It really is great, and has a super lightweight feel to it. I love the simplicity of it and the backlight has made a huge difference than a regular e reader with no light. However, the screen is EXTREMELY delicate. I had my Nook for less than a month when I dropped a pen on the screen accidentally, and a nick in the screen was left behind. It seems like the simplest of dings screw up the screen, and it becomes very distracting when there is a bright light leaking out of a nick in the screen. However, as long as you are careful with it, it shouldn't be a problem. I'm not rough with my Nook in any way (I have used my leather case for it since I bought the Nook and have never taken it off), but I am clumsy and that could be why I have screen damage. Another thing is after two years, my Nook is INCREDIBLY slow and glitchy. Mind you, I have only bought about twenty books on here and yet it still freezes or an error message appears almost every time I try to shop for a new book. The Nook also freezes often on the book I am reading, and I have to force it to restart (if it doesn't restart on its own which also happens occasionally). All in all this Nook is super functional and great, but apparently two years is it's lifespan. It's a good e reader for beginners or even those who aren't familiar or aren't looking for complex technology. However, you do get what you pay for in this instance and this Nook definitely is not built to last or have a memory capacity like the newer models of e readers. It's a great buy and is not a money pit like some reviews would have you believe, but if you are looking for a durable e reader that you won't have to replace for a good while definitely dish out the extra cash and invest in the Nook HD or even a Kindle Fire.\n",
      "47 I have had the 2nd and 3rd generation kindle, and the Kindle Fire HD in the past. I currently have an iPad mini, so I have the Nook and Kindle reading apps for that. But I have to say that I most enjoy the reading experience on my Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight. My iPad is nice, but honestly I'm on a computer all day at work so my eyes tend to get tired a lot quicker looking at another computer screen, for all intensive purposes. The Nook is much easier on the eyes, and I love how light it is to hold! I do not have mine in a case when I am reading, I bought a padded zippered pouch like holder for when it is not in use and it works well for protecting it while traveling.  I love the feel of the naked Nook. The curved back and rounded corners give it a very organic book like feel. The rubberized texture of the back gives it a nice feel too.  Sometimes I almost forget I'm not reading a real book!  The built in light is great, especially for those nights when my husband is ready to go to sleep and I want to read 'just a little bit longer.'  The light doesn't bother him at all and it's perfect for me to read in the dark. It's nice to be able to do so without the clunky clip on book lights of the past.\n",
      "48 The little lady sleeps with it almost every night. She loves the reader and is very happy with it so far. Without the glow light or connected to wifi it can go weeks. She uses the glow light at night (every night) and still gets days of use without charging. Scored major points for this purchase.\n",
      "49 I was super excited about this product, so much so that my boyfriend pre-ordered it for me so I got it the day it came out.  I was in love with the product for a while, until one night my softish, rubberized watch brushed up against the screen and left a small scratch that allows a bright annoying light to come through.  It's really quite annoying to look at while reading your book at night (which was the point of the whole device).  I've taken really good care of it, it has a padded case.  However, it seems like it is inevitable that the screen will get scratched by something.\n",
      "Cluster #: 16\n",
      "0 I read this book for my book club and it was wonderful. Easy read and once you start it, you will not be able to put it down.  One of the best books I have ever read.  Just make sure you have a box of tissues when reading it.  Enjoy!\n",
      "1 My first ereader. Initial impression is quite favorable. Got this as opposed to Kindle since it had a memory card and most of my ereading is pdf files of public domain literature found on web. Web reviews also very favorable as for Kindle. Additionally, the built in reading light was a significant selling point as it extends readability conditions. As to the screen lighting, it is childishly simple - just a row of 8 led lights across the top. Works OK; but, is clearly just top lighting spilling down across screen.\n",
      "2 I love this e-reader. It's incredibly durable. The battery lasts forever. It's simple. It has plenty of capacity. The screen is matte. It's the closest way to e-read and still feel like you're reading a paper book. It can read pdfs, epub, any format with no restrictions as to proprietary content.\n",
      "3 Love this eReader.  Sad they no longer make it but in researching found it was the best way to convert from paper books to a eReader. Very simple, it's for books and only books you have Internet just to download books and that's it. And as a bookworm makes it so much easier to read than paper books. Not water proof but you know I dropped it in a tub of water and ot still works fine. I have no clue how many times I've dropped it and still works great no issues at all\n",
      "4 The thing with an e-ink reader that is specifically for books you dont need the latest snapdragon cpu this thing does it's job and does it well and because it came out a long time ago it's now dirt cheap.\n",
      "5 Exactly what I wanted. Very easy to use and the battery lasts longer than I expected. I took it on an 18 hour flight with me to Sweden and did not have to recharge it once. If you are looking for just a simple ebook for reading, I highly recommend this. I will be buying another one for my mother for Christmas.\n",
      "6 i have owned 2 different e books and used 4, this is my favorite so far. the touch screen works better than i thought it would and seems scratch resistnant, i prefer it to the ones with buttons because you dont have to push to turn the page. it has a great battery life, i have used mine for 2 months and only charged it twice, and i read for hours on end. the screen has good resolution and is easy to read, even in the sun. my favorite part about this ebook is that it is compatible with multiple software programs, my literati would only accept books from the sponsor website, and i have a whole library already on my computer so this has been a plus.my only complaint is that it sometimes freezes up and needs to be reset, this has happened probably 6 times, it always seems fine after rebooting but it is still annoying, i think it may be because mine was used.\n",
      "7 It is the greatest e-reader on the market because it is inexpensive and can be upgraded. I upgraded mine, and I lost some of the battery duration, but I is still from 7 to 10 days and it is charged on less than 30 minutes, so I do not mind.\n",
      "8 I would recommend this to all.  My daughter loves it and the big screen adjustable typeface make it a breeze to use, even for parents :)  Ordering books is so easy and you can download not only to your nook but to your laptop etc....for the same price.  Quality item and she really loves the illuminated background for traveling at night.\n",
      "9 Love this ereader..user friendly in making notes and highlights..you just have to put in a memory card so you will not experience slowing down in making notes..have used mine in making notes for my bible reading such have plenty of notes to write..\n",
      "10 So glad I chose this!! It's easy to operate, has a clear picture, and the lighting doesn't hurt your eyes. It's also small enough that I can take it anywhere without a hassle. I love that I can just tap a word and be able to look it up or highlight it. And the battery life is amazing. I've been using it for 2 weeks and still have a nearly full charge.\n",
      "11 This is my first reader and after a month of using it, I'm still very happy with it. It's easy to use, easy (for the eyes) to read, and has a very reliable battery-life. It's also light and offers a good hand grip with its rubber back cover. I got it delivered very quickly. The only surprise I had, but then it explains why this model is a lot less expensive compared to the others is that this one is the first generation of Nook. It has only a few hundred Mb of internal memory and does not have back-lid screen to allow you to read  in the dark. But, since it has a slot for a 32Gb external microSD, and I don't use it in the dark, it is a perfect quality-priced for me.\n",
      "12 Nice e-reader. Still have experienced no issues with the backlight version - haven't seen any \"tearing\" in the screen as others have reported.\n",
      "13 Love the light up feature, and the option with the fonts size.  I can see the writing clearly, no matter what time of day; and with the adjustment of the font it's better than dealing with the regular text on a book. I do a lot of reading and now I have a place to store my favorite books, instead of the attic.\n",
      "14 This is the second Nook ive owned. I was satisfied with the first and even more with the second. (The first didnt break or have any defects.) I love the compact size and the online capability of it. You can use a computer and login using your acount. You can review books, buy or get samples of books, and share books with your friends. The all touch screen makes flipping the page a snap! WOuld buy another any time!\n",
      "15 Simply the best in terms of price and functionality. And if you root it you can access your email, read the online newspapers, post on facebook, etc. An excellent device.\n",
      "16 I have the normal simple touch, which I love. But I wanted to get the glowLight for my dad. He really likes it and right away downloaded a book :-) we are very happy readers!\n",
      "17 I just want a device I can read books on.  Not big like other devices, love the glowlight (no more needing booklights).  I have purchased more than one.  Friends love it too.\n",
      "18 I had the old nook and I just love this one better.  The glow light makes reading for my 55+ eyes so easy.  This is a great reader and is superior to my $500 tablet.\n",
      "19 compact and easy to read, both inside and outside.  Came quickly, packed well and in good condition.\n",
      "20 Relatively easy to use. Enjoying reading in bed without the issue of turning pages or holding a thick or heavy book open. Easy to plop into my purse for travel. I may want to upgrade to the colored and lit version, but will test this one out further.\n",
      "21 Easy to use, bright screen and since its capacity can be expanded up to 32 gb by adding a micro sd card I think it is better than a Kindle. With this ability you are practically able to carry a library worth thousands of books. Also mobi and other file types can be easily converted to epub and organized using the free Calibre software you can download from the Calibre website. I have also purchased a CaseCrown Regal Flip Case from Amazon at a bargain price. It fits the Nook very well and is also a beautifull case.\n",
      "22 This was purchased to replace an older, defective, Simple Touch reader. It performs well and I am very satisfied with it.\n",
      "23 Really enjoying my Nook.  Easy to use and I'm able to check books out of my local library and download from websites like Project Gutenberg online (as well as purchase books from B&N)!\n",
      "24 I love this it is just what I was wanting for just reading books.  It is very light and fits in my purse perfectly.\n",
      "25 Love how light it is! Perfect to tuck into a small bag to carry any where! I keep it tucked into my bag for any opertunity to pull it out and read.\n",
      "26 after holding out for so long in converting from paper to digital, i decided to take the plunge and buy the nook.  i wanted something simple, no frills, so this fit the bill perfectly.  i researched kindle versus nook, and i'm a happy customer with this nook.  very compact, lightweight, and i love the ease of downloading books.\n",
      "27 Delivery was fast. This nook was just what I wanted, just a reader with WiFi. No other apps taking up space and slowing it down.\n",
      "28 Fantastic device!  Easy to use, simple to carry.  Does exactly what it says on the box.  Mounts w/o any strangeness right on the desktop so you can move epub files on and off it as you wish, with no additional software.  Love it.\n",
      "29 The glow light option is awesome and easy to use. My son reads on it all the time and it works great.\n",
      "30 Fantastically lightweight and easy to read with. Its a great e-reader. Its well worth the same amount of money it costs as its works easily and well and makes reading a joy. Best for those you just want to read books.\n",
      "31 My wife  is 110 % satisfied with her new easy reader and I'm thrilled she doesn';t have to turn on the light to read with the glow option\n",
      "32 but it will serve the purpose of replacing paperbacks for my son who is in the military. Convenient sized, easy to use after the software issue was resolved. The online support was very patient in helping me figure out why I couldn't connect and how to download the required software update. Works fine now.\n",
      "33 Bought this for my 92 year old mother, & I wasn't sure if she could manage a \"electronic\" reader, but she loves it! It is easy for her to operate & lightweight for her to hold for a long time, since she reads all day.\n",
      "34 Great little e-reader especially if you want to read outside.  The screen is excellent and the battery lasts for days.  It's light weight and easy to fit in your purse or back pack.  The internet on it is a little slow, but that's not very important to me.\n",
      "35 Haven't had it but a few weeks, but I am learning how to download from the library, etc.  love how light it is and that it will tuck away in a purse for easy reading anywhere.  No operating problems so far.  Would recommend it for home or away\"\n",
      "36 Best E-reader I've owned This model no longer produced was happy to find this one!\n",
      "37 The Nook Simple Touch is a great little e-reader. It's easy to use and displays books well. It handles pdf files better than my husband's Sony T1 reader, which I have been delighted by as I often get review copies of books in pdf format.\n",
      "38 I am so pleased with my new Nook Touch. I have already purchased 4 books and am reading them all. The best part is that there are so many good books that are free ( even one OT/NT free Bible)and most others are under $10. There is also the ability to read samples of books before you buy without going out of the house because the Nook has Wi-Fi.\n",
      "39 Smart, sleek and easy-to-read, this Nook is my first E-reader and I am very happy with it. Easy to use all the controls on it and it features an easy to understand manual so you can access all of the reader's many features. Good price, too.\n",
      "40 This was purchased as a present for an 8 year old, it is easy to use (add books, change books, read on). The text is clear and does not cause any more eye strain than a normal books.\n",
      "41 Exactly as described, wonderful condition, easy to use. Great for no nonsense book reading.  Awesome battery life, plenty of storage, with room for expansion if needed. All around excellent.\n",
      "42 In my opinion, the Nook Simple Touch is the best e-reader on the market because... well... it's simple. No distractions of email or social media, it lets me immerse myself in a book and I love it!\n",
      "43 I know that there are reviews that warn against this item, but we have been very pleased with it.  Haven't run into any complications, but haven't had it that long.  If all you need is a reader, this is an awesome way to go!\n",
      "44 Love this eBook Reader.  Simple to use. Easy to read screen.  Am very pleased with this item and am satisfied with size.\n",
      "45 Easy to use and, after updating firmware to get rid of ghosting issues, great image quality.\n",
      "46 Great device to read academic papers/pdfs on the go with no LED eye strain.\n",
      "47 Excellent little Reader!  No glare, easy on the eyes, very functional.  Why pay more for another brand when this does the job excellently!  I highly recommend.\n",
      "48 Super low price new condition I use it everyday!!\n",
      "49 I didn't know if I would like an e-reader.  But I love it.  I love the glow lite.  I use it all the time.  It was easy to understand how to use it I wonder why it took so long to get one.\n",
      "50 I love it!  Crisp clear page!  I sit outside in my lawn chair in the bright sunlight and read without a problem!  My daughter took it to the beach with her and loves it!\n",
      "51 Easy to use.  I got it mainly for the ability to adjust the font size for easier reading as the public library has a limited number of large print books.  When we travel I don't have to lug around 3-4 books.  The Nook fits easily in a small travel bag or purse.\n",
      "52 Classic!  I'm very glad to own this book in it's Kindle edition and for a very reasonable price too, $0.00!\n",
      "53 nice unit... works perfect. Love using it.  beats my sons kindle.  I love that it shows the actual pages, rather than % of book read like kindle.\n",
      "54 Exceptional. I am very happy with my purchase. Now I can read their books dyubimye in any conditions. The book is very compact and I wear it in a jacket pocket.\n",
      "55 Love the Simple Touch, it is light weight, fits my purse and easy to run. The battery lasts several days of heavy reading. I have a Simple Touch that is at least 10 yrs old and still runs fine. I bought this nook just in case the old one quit.\n",
      "56 I choose this product because it's capable of support diferent formats, I convert my pdf files in EPUB whit free programs (calibre and sigil) and mi readings are now easy and the graphics are visualized correctly.\n",
      "57 My daughter has one an we love it. It's easy to hold and light weight. Buying books is so easy and affordable.\n",
      "58 This is my 1st reader so I can't compare.  I like the sharpness of the letters.  It makes for easy reading.  In conjunction with calibre this is really easy to use.\n",
      "59 I was looking for a cheap reader and wow I'm amazed with this item. The item looks like new and it it arrived in perfect condition. The seller made sure it was well protected\n",
      "60 With all the weekly magazines going digital, this is a nice device for use when reading magazines along with breakfast.  Works great with books too!!\n",
      "61 This is a great e-reader. Easy to hold and turn pages.  I haven't had the opportunity to use it for outdoor reading yet, but I suspect it will be easy to read even in direct sunlight.\n",
      "62 The wife's loves it. I bought this one mostly for the way it reads and it's not a tablet.\n",
      "63 This audio book is ok, the narrator is rather bland\n",
      "64 Simple, easy to use. I can make the print large enough to read. Many free books out there.\n",
      "65 I would highly recommend this item to anyone just wanting an e-reader it's great!!  It arrived very quickly and in great shape.\n",
      "66 Great product, easy to use and set up--after comparing pros and cons this was the one for me. I especially liked that I could download books from my community library and other sites. I wasn't tied just to a brand name download. Shipped quickly too.\n",
      "67 Extremely long battery life, easiness of use, low weight, high build quality, huge book selection, and affordable price make this hands down the best e-reader you can buy for under $100.  Very impressed.\n",
      "68 Easy to read, use, great for laying against leg as it does not slip so hands and arms are more relaxed. Two different options for turning pages as one reads is very useful. The changing of the pages (on all ereaders) must be gotten use to, but not a bad negative.\n",
      "69 Got my nook in the mail a few days ago and its perfect. It brought everything as said in the description. I added books to my library and I've had no problems so far. Very pleased!\n",
      "70 No lights, no internet.  Just a simple easy to use reader.  Just what I wanted.\n",
      "71 Works great. I love the e-ink screen, its so much easier to read on than my ipad.\n",
      "72 For a user who only want's the basics, this is perfect. It's very simple and easy to use and it's small enough to carry in a purse, I just love it. You will keep your books forever which is my favorite part.\n",
      "73 I am looking forward to reading this.  I just love these little books and have a number of the Collector's Library series.  The ribbon is very handy and doesn't fall out of the book like a paper bookmark does.\n",
      "74 I wanted a simple reader and it was just what I wanted.\n",
      "75 Very good technically, however in Europe we don't feel the necessity of the B&N bookstore ! Instead the wifi could be used for searching and downloading directly from the net.\n",
      "76 Easy to download and easy to read. Hods a charge very well.\n",
      "77 This is my first e-reader and I love it. The e ink is very easy on the eyes. A backlight would be nice.\n",
      "78 My child already has a gaming system so she doesn't need anything for apps so this was the right thing for her. It is only for reading.She loves to read and this encourages that wonderful hobby. I am going to order the light that attaches to it though because it is harder to see than my nook color.\n",
      "79 Love that I am able to check out library books from home.  Dont have to leave the house.  Love it\n",
      "80 Switched to the Kindle Paperwhite recently and I like it much better.  Better interface.  And shaped a bit narrower so its a lot easier to hold in one hand.\n",
      "81 4 stars because it's really easy to use, you can find a lot of books the battery lasts for about 2-3 weeks (and i read about 6 hours a day at least).\n",
      "82 I'm giving 5 stars for best value for money, excellent design and quality of display. Touch screen and micro sd card support adds real value to user. I am able to store over 2000 books and still have plenty of room for more. Also PDF format support is perfect. All of that without commercials and for same price as Amazon Kindle classic. :)\n",
      "83 Love this product.  Love the screen display.  You can read this outdoors in bright sun or in a semi dark room.  This is just what I was looking for in a mid-priced E-reader.\n",
      "84 no problems whatsoever! Came in a sleeve with its own charger and after it was charged up, it worked beautifully!\n",
      "85 Its perfect travel size. Easy downloads. I just love it ! Came in pretty fast and even though the case had some wear it was amazing. Thanks !\n",
      "86 Awesome little device, i've been using it daily and I haven't noticed any problems yet.\n",
      "87 Easy read - really like reading on my Kindle\n",
      "88 I have been using this device for the last year and a half. I love it. I have had no problems; works like it should. I was surprised to see so many people had received defective devices and wanted to let you know that these are amazing ereaders and you can have a perfectly normal, blah experience like me. It is no better or worse than any other ereader out there. It is my second, so most of my review will be a comparison.\n",
      "89 I read the electronic version. Typical Sherlock Holmes/Arthur Conan Doyle mystery. If you like unaltered SH mysteries in original text it is a good read. I like the electronic version -- it is easy to take with me anywhere-- shopping, traveling, waiting in offices, etc. plus I can also read it on any device at hand; i.e., smartphone, laptop or tablet & return quickly to the last page read.\n",
      "90 the best parts: the touch screen, the battery life, the contours (easy to hold), and the fact that it reads epubs and pdfs well.\n",
      "91 Very good and portable reader, easy to see with different fonts to choose from and very easy to hold especially when placed in protective cover\n",
      "92 Has a faint line across reading screen. But it's readable, so not a real problem.\n",
      "93 This is one of the first books I've read on my new Kindle. I love the portability and how easy it is to read in daylight. My favorite feature is that I have an automatic bookmark (unless I accidentally press the back or forward buttons too long).\n",
      "94 I love my eBook reader. It is real easy to buy ebooks with it, almost to easy.The only drawback with it is that it is not glowlight one.\n",
      "95 Second one we bought. Only wanted for books. Compact and Easy to work with and excellent price.\n",
      "96 Have been using for over a year now and for my purpose, it is great.  I like to read and I don't need the extra fluff that comes on the ones that include wi-fi.  Great for the value!\n",
      "97 I love it! Small, light and easy to carry in my purse.\n",
      "98 I couldn't wait to upgrade to this product from the Simple Touch that had no light.  It has worked well, with no problems.  Both Nooks get a little glitchy, I've noticed, when the charge starts getting low.  I will also say that it's my impression that downloading from libraries is still relatively new process; haven't tried it yet myself, and not all libraries even offer the service.  I don't object to the ads; they are not intrusive, and I just don't look at them if I'm not up for it.  However, as with all e-readers, realize that e-books are no bargain, most of the time. Most of the books I've read cost about 10 dollars.  I've downloaded free books from Google e-books that would otherwise have cost a small fortune.  It's nice not to have to find a home for a book that I've read but don't want to keep.  With this product, the advantages are that it is lightweight, you can increase/change the font and size, which is a huge advantage if you have vision issues, you don't accumulate physical books that you don't want to keep, and the Glowlight at night is fantastic when you want to read when your partner is ready for lights out.  I had a clip-on light with the original Simple Touch and it was inconvenient as far as placement, glare, etc.  We have a Kindle e-reader as well, and I much prefer the touchscreen on the Nook to the buttons on the Kindle for page turning.\n",

      "0 I'm not exactly certain how many of us are reading these stories for the first time. Holmes & Watson form a most engaging pair as they set about solving mysteries. As always, these are mostly riveting.\n",
      "1 \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" is classic mystery reading from the 19th century.  I never would have bought the book, except that it's free on the Kindle and I needed something to read in a pinch.  I downloaded it, and I'm glad that I did.  The story-telling takes some getting used to, due to the style of English used during that period.  But once you've read a few of the stories, you get used to it.  Among the 12 mysteries in the book, my favorites were \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\" and \"The Blue Carbuncle\".  But all 12 were fun to read.\n",
      "2 This Kindle freebie is great for readers who are only keen to read the adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The stories contained within this title are:\n",
      "3 Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels and short stories are always a treat.  This collection is no exception.  If you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, or even if you've never read any of Doyle's Sherlock stories before, this book is a good continuation/introduction of the world-famous sleuth.  However, if you'd like to start out at the 'beginning', I suggest reading the novels first, like I did.  I purchased The Complete Illustrated Novels of Sherlock Holmes and read those first.  Then I read this collection of short stories.  I will next be purchasing and reading The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes.  This order I have listed, from what I have gathered, contains Doyle's works in chronological publishing order.  The only reason I would suggest reading them in this order is that later stories make mention of events and characters from the earlier novels and stories.\n",
      "4 This is a collection of twelve cases Sherlock Holmes solved, told through the perspective of his accomplice Watson. All of them are pretty short, which only takes about 1 hour 15 minutes to read one case. However, after a while, the cases start to sound kind of similar. For example, a few of the cases' victims are all enticed by money to do something, then find that it is suspicious, so they seek help from Holmes. A few of the cases sadly involve family conflict, with money and greed being the biggest issues. I liked the last two cases the most, the adventure of the Beryl Coronet and Copper Beeches. I didn't like the man with the twisted lip, because Doyle shouldn't discredit homeless people...\n",
      "5 I picked up the Sherlock Holmes Complete Collection because my mom had already downloaded it and I was mildly curious.  Holmes was the best book I've read in a while, definately my favorite in the Mystery genre.\n",
      "6 Prior to this, the only Sherlock Holmes I had attempted to read was \"The Hound of The Baskervilles\" which I started at least twice and never finished. I have been enjoying the PBS series \"Sherlock\" and a friend mentioned that some of the events on that series corresponded to the books, so when this book came up on Amazon as free, I downloaded it.\n",
      "7 During a period of my life that I spent catching up on all the classic works that I'd never foudn time for, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes stands out.\n",
      "8 This ebook compiles 12 of the best and most well-known Sherlock Holmes stories. They're quite entertaining, and they're short, so it's easy to sneak one in when you have a little spare time.\n",
      "9 I could go on about the Sherlock Holmes stories, but seeing as how there are plenty of reviews for The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes itself, I'll just review the BBC Books reprint.\n",
      "10 As I sat at my study I heard a knock at the door. There, to my surprise stood my dear friend, Sherlock Holmes. \"May I come in, Watson? I have a puzzling problem that I need your help solving.\" \"Certainly,\" I replied. Sherlock entered and began to tell me of his plight. He had been contacted by Strand magazine to record some of his most interesting cases. But having no writing skills was in a quandary as to whom to ask to tackle his momentious task. Of course I accepted the duty with great relish (and enjoyment, I must add). After the prodigious job was completed I queried, \"Who will illustrate your work, my dear Sherlock?\" \"It's elementary, my dear Watson,\" he exclaimed. \"Only Sidney Padget is up to the task!\"  And the rest is, as they say, history.\n",
      "11 Any one over the age of 50 should remember Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes.  All the Sherlock Holmes movies were in black and white, and they always took place in the streets of London.  A very gloomy scenario.\n",
      "12 I have been a Law Enforcement Officer for 47 years. It was interesting to go back and read a Classic of deduction in the step by step solving of various cases!\n",
      "13 I've loved Sherlock  Holmes since I was 9 and first read The Hound of the Baskervilles. When I purchased this book, I looked forward to re-reading some of my favorites. It was surprising that this book didn't begin with A Study in Scarlet. Others were missing, too.\n",
      "14 A classic text, which I first discovered on my grandfather's book shelf as a 13 year old and have returned to many times over my lifetime.  Of course the various modern TV and film versions are known to many nowadays and the cult Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created is still as popular, though drifting more and more into science fiction and fantasy of late.  It gave me the idea of becoming a forensic scientist, but I did not follow this aspiration, except to become another kind of pathologist and to observe and interpret in a way that in many ways was similar to Sherlock Holmes himself.  Such is the power and attraction of Doyle's fictional character to me!\n",
      "15 The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was one of the first books that I downloaded when I got my Kindle.  I read these stories twenty plus years ago and had enjoyed them then, so I decided that I needed to get this and to have another read.  While the language is slightly dated, the layout makes it an easy read.  My recommendation is to treat it as something you're going to read over time and not something to plough through from cover to cover.  The stories are interesting and with the return of Sherlock Holmes to both the big and little screen, relevant to understanding the great detective.  I highly recommend this book.\n",
      "16 To say it's Sherlock Holmes would be enough except for this 20 word limit imposed by Amazon :-). If you're a lover of classic mystery stories, as I am, this book will be a delight. The collection contains stories as chronicled by Sherlock Holmes' able bodied assistant James Watson, The mysteries are always intriguing to Holmes and unique in such a way that they pose some form of deductive challenge for the world's best deductive reasoner. Once you begin to read you will be taken back to old England in a time where the world was just beginning to use science as a means of development rather than warfare and chivalry was still alive and kicking, this book is a must read for all you book lovers!!\n",
      "17 I have always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes, the stories are just so intresting and entertaining. I read through this collection one story at a time, as I was laying in bed. The length of each story is perfect to use as a bed time story. I have already read all of these stories, but it has been so long that it was great to read them again. If by chance you have not read them, you owe it to yourself to find out what you have been missing. Also, with the stories being in public domain - they're free, so you have nothing to complain about.\n",
      "18 I gave the collection four stars not the writing nor the stories. I felt that the collection should have been a bit longer. In today's post-Doyle world there are two different approaches to making Sherlock Holmes characters, consistent with Arthur Canon Doyle's work or only in name similar.  Movies, and television have simulated caricatures of some form or another of the main people and this has made the classic writing harder to relate to if there is not enough writing to redeveloped the characters anew.  The collection might have been enough at one time but the collection exists now in a multimedia world and those characterizations invade the original which makes the original, need more support of character development to offset the preconceived notions. I know this is harsh and is not a critique of the author but it is a fact of losing poetic license.\n",
      "19 I have always enjoyed Sherlock Holmes stories and this book of course doesn't disappoint. That said there aren't many of the more famous stories in this book. Many of them are short and once in a blue moon rely on Sherlock solving the puzzle using information previously unknowable by the reader. However these mysteries are more for enjoying the journey, not trying to solve the mystery yourself. I would have liked some of them to be about twice as long as they were. Right after getting into it, it ends.\n",
      "20 This​ book is actually 12 stories featuring Sherlock Holmes and his partner Watson. Narrated from Watson's point of view, he regales us with some of the lesser known, yet still very thrilling, mysteries solved by Sherlock. If you love any of either the movies or the BBC mini series, you will definitely like to this book because they all ring true to this, the original stories of Mr. Holmes and Watson.\n",
      "21 I originally downloaded this collection of short stories in preparation for the Sherlock Holmes major motion picture that was coming out in 2009. As someone who had never read any of Sherlock Holmes' tales, this was a perfect introduction into the kind of stories Sir Arthur Conan Doyle penned for the legendary Holmes and Dr. Watson.\n",
      "22 An excellent selection of Holmes stories! It really was difficult to put down my Kindle while I was reading. This was my first experience with any of the original Holmes stories and I feel quite satisfied to have started here. Fellow fans of Holmes film interpretations will get a real kick out of these original adventures.\n",
      "23 Although the stories are public domain, I adored this publication of the well-known Sherlock Holmes stories. I recently began watching the BBC series, Sherlock, and instantly was captivated by it. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman convincingly and magnificently portrayed Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, respectively, and the writing of the show was equally impressive. Once I had finished season 1, which didn't take long as most Sherlockians know, I turned to the original Sherlock Holmes book series, to bide my time waiting for season 2 to air in America. I downloaded this copy of \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" on to my iPad, only because of the cover. The stories are incredible. Captivating and interesting, I could barely put the book down, unfortunately enough for my grades! At the end of the book, I found I had a better appreciation for the work Moffat and Gatiss put into the new series and for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories.\n",
      "24 This collection of short stories about Sherlock Holmes was quite enjoyable.  There are a total of 12 stories and each one can be read in 10 - 15 minutes.  They always had an interesting problem to solve and Sherlock did it brilliantly.  I can see why he is considered one of the greatest fictional detectives ever.\n",
      "25 I had to read four Sherlock Holmes stories for school and since this book had all four,I downloaded it.I enjoyed the storie,especially The Speckled Band,but since this edition does not have a table of contents it was very hard to go to the storie I neaded.I had to go page by page to get  to the one I had to read!Also,every time a number was used alot of symbols were placed with it,making it imposible to read.So even though I enjoyed the stories,these errors distracted  and anoyed me.I hope the publishers fix them.\n",
      "26 These Sherlock Holmes adventures are very enjoyable and entertaining either at home or in the car. This is not an actual production with actors and sound effects, but a single person David Timmons, truly a \"man of a thousand voices and dialects\"..... both male and female.\n",
      "27 If you like Sherlock Holmes the movie or television show then cast your eyes upon Sir Arthur Conan Doyle original masterpiece with this read.  Engage your mind in the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes the way Sir Arthur created and compare with today's version .  You will find both young and older readers whether reading for the first time or many times over you will be swept up in the adventures and not want to put it down.  A classic.\n",
      "28 I enjoy re-reading the Sherlock stories over and over again. Alway enjoyable.\n",
      "29 This is where forensic science all started.  Sherlock has to smell, feel, hear, observe, and even taste, sometimes, to uncover details that were overlooked at crime scenes at the time the book was written.  The book is very engaging, and even though it is a series of adventures that don't require having read previous tales to understand, you will still not want to put the book down until you have helped Sherlock Holmes solve all the crimes.\n",
      "30 I so liked this book, I would be thrilled to read the Sherlock Holmes stories every day, over and over.  This is probably true because I was enthralled with them in my childhood, many, many years ago.\n",
      "31 A collection of 12 stories as it was originally published by Strand Magazine, this new publication by Top Five Classic of \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Illustrated) includes the original accompanying illustrations by Sidney Paget.\n",
      "32 If you've never read Sherlock Holmes stories, join the club!  That's what brought me to read this, and I was fascinated by the conversational tone of Watson's narration and Holmes' eccentricities. As a fan of the TV show \"Elementary,\" reading the \"real deal\" has provided some insights into the TV Holmes character that have helped me appreciate that show even more. In that case, I can call this a \"win-win\" read.\n",
      "33 I bought this for my grandson for a project in his 7th grade class, but I also read it.  As a group of short stories, it was interesting and worth reading but not as appealing as the other, longer Sherlock Holmes books I have read.  The style of writing and introduction of characters give the reader a taste of who and what the great detective Sherlock Holmes is all about.\n",
      "34 Sherlock is always a good read for mystery buffs.  This did not disappoint.\n",
      "35 I really like the Sherlock Holmes stories. Of course I knew about the characters, and have seen references to them in other books/tv shows, but I had never read the originial stories.\n",
      "36 This was the first Anthony Horowitz Sherlock Holmes novel that I had read and it was did not disappoint. As a self-proclaimed mystery aficianado, this book has been on my to read list for sometime and now I have done it.\n",
      "37 I'm familiar with all these cases but Sherlock is always worth reprising.  Watson's delightful short accounts make each a perfect read commuting on public transit, or at lunch or bedtime.  Enjoy!\n",
      "38 Its Sherlock Holmes. Many of these stories have been parodied over the years by pop culture, so it is hard to be surprised or pretend like you don't know what is around the next corner. That said, there are still a few nuanced plot twists that keep it interesting and fun even if you aren't a classic literature fan.\n",
      "39 Haven't finished this book yet but I'm absolutely LOVING IT! It's like getting to know the 'REAL' Sherlock Holmes all over again. I like 'Elementary' and the twist of Watson being a woman; also that it's set in New York but there really is something about an original.\n",
      "40 I liked the book overall but I do have some things to mention.  I noticed on my downloaded copy to my Kindle that there was issues with how currency was typed.  In the text whenever a value or sum was discussed I was unable to decipher the amount.  The other thing worth noting is you are not getting all the Sherlock Holmes stories. I gave it four stars because of the textual errors on the downloaded version.\n",
      "41 Sherlock Holmes is a timeless character. You can read these stories again and again without getting tired of them. Sherlock Holmes and Watson are two fascinating people. Against a backdrop of Victorian England, these stories are fascinating. Sometimes one can deduce the crime and sometimes not. It does not matter. Watching Holmes at work is a privilege. I highly recommend this book and all Sherlock Holmes books.\n",
      "42 Been a fan of Sherlock Holmes novels for over 40+ years.  A third of this book could have been edited out. Long in-depth descriptions of facts not related to any part of the body of the story. Found myself halfway through the book fast-forwarding past these long useless detailed descriptions, looking for the beginning of the story again. Disappointing and surprising since it was sanctioned by the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Estate. Surely Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Unique Literary Skills have not been applied or considered by his Estate in this Sanctioning.  Sad!!!!\n",
      "43 I've never read any of the original Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle.  After reading this book, I purchased the complete Sherlock Holmes on my Kindle and am thoroughly enjoying reading the short stories and novels.  House of Silk is well written, great descriptions of places and people.  As a Holmes novice, I can't discern a great deal of difference between the originals and this story.\n",
      "44 Great Sherlock Holmes! I was surprised by how faithful the author was to the characters and the style, while creating something so original. I didn’t put it together until I finished book that this is same Anthony Horowitz as Foyle’s War series. I am playing catch-up with his other books now.\n",
      "45 I discovered Holmes as a child and spent many quiet hours embarking on chases through London and around the world, hobnobbing with kings and with street urchins.\n",
      "46 If you have never read any Holmes, this is the definitely the place to start. After reading the first of the twelve stories, A Scandal in Bohemia, I was definitely hooked. I have since finished, The Sign of the Four.\n",
      "47 I approach Sherlock Holmes pastiches with a great deal of trepidation.  Being a lover of the original cannon, I have read too many lousy mimics.  In fact, I had quit reading them until I came across this work authorized by the Conan Doyle estate.  I decided to dip my toe into the stream one more time.\n",
      "48 I read this book for my monthly mystery book club.  The entire club thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I know Sir Doyle would be proud to have a book like this written about his famous hero, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\n",
      "49 My dad is a Sherlock Holmes fan.\n",
      "50 It’s easy to believe that this is an original, long lost Sherlock Holmes story. It sits happily amongst all his other delightful and page turning adventures. Once I reached about a third the way in I was well and truly hooked.  I abandoned the jobs of my day and read through to the most satisfying conclusion.\n",
      "51 I have read with pleasure this new addition to the chronicles of Sherlock Holmes.  The tempo, though slightly different, is exactly as I remember Holmes stories to be.  Anyone wishing to revisit the twist and turns of this most famous detective should certainly read this book.  This story is not for the faint of heart.  It is a lot more modern in its rendition than Sir Arthur would have written but holds the suspense until the last, if not more graphic in its telling. Loved the book.\n",
      "52 I am a long time devotee of Sherlock Holmes, so I was a bit skeptical of this book. I am happy to say I was wrong! It's just very, very good and I think fans of the original stories will not be disappointed.\n",
      "53 After just reading the compete works of Sherlock Holmes, I was hungry for more adventures.  This piece echoes closely the style of the original works and attempts to draw connections between some of A.C.D.'s individual mysteries.  The writing is more detailed and 2 mysteries are interweaved into one, which is more satisfying for modern readers who are also well familiar with crime television.  I highly recommend this book, however, I do agree with another reviewer that this book is not for young readers...personally, I would not allow my son to read it until he has reached adulthood.\n",
      "54 I love Sherlock Holmes mystery books. but I really like reading them better on my new Kindle Touch.  The print is perfect and the pages turn so easy that one can get lost in the mystery and not have to worry about pages that turn themselves, especially in a new book.  The price for this book was $0.00.  Can't beat that!!!!\n",
      "55 This is twelve of the numerous Sherlock Holmes cases that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote through his lifetime, there are some issues within the text where the symbol for the pound appears as some sort of code, same with some of what I assume are meant to be letters with various punctuation associated with them, if it were not for that, I would give this five stars.\n",
      "56 I have always enjoyed Sherlock Holmes but have not read Doyle's work for many years.  This set of cases which I read on my Kindle for free rekindled my interest and I plan to start reading one of the more comprehensive Holmes Kindle collections soon.\n",
      "57 I have always been a fan of Sherlock Holmes & despite the fact that numerous adaptions of the character have been presented in movies & television I still can't imagine any true fan being willing to forgo the actual written words that gave inception to this iconic character... I am ashamed to say that I have not given them the attention they deserve in the past... P.S. NOT A SCAM!\n",
      "58 I've always heard about how weird Sherlock Holmes was, but no one ever told me exactly how.  I got this for the sake of curiosity more than anything else. (I usually do SiFi)  I have to admit, this was really great.  Now I know where a lot of inspiration comes from when I read other stories or watch TV.\n",
      "59 After seeing the second movie featuring Robert Downey Jr I wanted to read all the original stories of Sherlock Holmes, at first I was a little disappointed that the two characters weren't the same but after a while I preferred the one in these books. All the stories in this version (and future ones as well) are amazing, I have since continued on to other stories featuring Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr. Watson.Reading this book was a pleasure.\n",
      "60 If you enjoy sherlock holmes you will love this collection. For me was a time for rediscover sherlock as i hadn't read it since i was a child. Now i noticed a lot of other little dqrk details as his problem with  adiction to heavy drugs and the interest of dr watson frienship\n",
      "61 Sherlock Holmes, according to Dr. Watson, is an enigma.  He finds answers where there doesn't seem to be any.  A book worth reading at least 2 or 3 times in you life time.\n",
      "62 Super when I am on an airplane and have forgotten to turn on the wireless to pick up new books.  Doyle never ceases to amaze and provide entertainment.  I think I started reading Holmes in the 60s (early 60s) and have yet to stop.  Good emergency book to have if you have a Kindle and enjoy deductive reasoning.  easons to get it are elementary my dear reader!\n",
      "63 I had not read the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes before, so this free kindle download was my first taste of the legend himself.\n",
      "64 Even after being done over and over in movies to the point of humdrum, the Arthur Conan Doyle Sherlock Holmes stories remain very entertaining. I have read these many times and continue to find points I missed. I started with a collection when I was around 12 years old. This was an Ebook I got for my Kindle. I keep it with me faithfully.\n",
      "65 This has been on my Kindle since I bought it. I was on a business trip with nothing to read.  I remembered Sherlock Holmes.  A very enjoyable read.\n",
      "Cluster #: 18\n",
      "0 I should love this book.  The premise is an old favorite, kids with a rough life find a benefactor.  Will they win his heart over?  This is normally a premise I find interesting, because it can be told in so many ways and take so many twists.  It seems always so simple at first, but it never is.\n",
      "1 I brought this as a Christmas present for my Gran. My Gran is a huge fan of war-romance novels and has read many of them in her time. Although I have not read this book myself, gran was pleased to have something that wasn't fiction but still her favourite genre. She enjoyed it hugely and stated she would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed similar books.\n",
      "2 have read quite a lot of books like this and yes this was the same kind of thing, but wasn't as in depth as the other books i have read. was still very good thought and would recommend for anyone else interested in this kind of subject\n",
      "3 What I found most interesting about this book was the contemporary story line. It addressed, in an exaggerated fashion, many issues that surround our society today. The characters were relatable and represented people you would cross paths with throughout life. This was such an easy read and I found myself not wanting to put it down. I have recommended this book to several people and think it is well worth the read.\n",
      "4 This is a \"cute\" and interesting book for teens.  The reader that has never encountered this type of book before will be pleasantly surprised.  The content and writing quality is average, but I think this would be a great gift for a quirky, fun seeking pre-teen!\n",
      "5 I loved this book. It had mystery, suspense and a great plot. The phone numbers were also good and when called, each one gave you something different.\n",
      "6 The maps were missing  form the front but other wise it was avery interesting story. I loved alt he art work and doodles around  the story. Very creative.\n",
      "7 Cathy's Book by Sean Stewart and Jordan Weisman has all the trappings of a typical young adult novel including just enough romantic, intrigue, and rebellious behavior to keep teen readers engaged. When you combine the social technology with the attractive journal format, this otherwise run-of-the-mill story becomes even more compelling.\n",
      "8 Cathy is not only a funky dresser, but also creative, clever, fun, curious and an artist extraordinaire. From the book's exciting cover, which states in gray letters against a black background \"Cathy's Book if found call (650) 266-8233,\" to the ensuing pages of artistic doodles and adventures, this is one terrific read. Sean Stewart and Jordan Weisman have gone out on a limb with some daring ideas and succeeded in creating an interactive, totally hands-on reading experience that teens will go wild for.\n",
      "9 CATHY'S BOOK is being marketed as a new kind of young adult novel. It's interactive, with a pocket of 'evidence', real phone numbers and websites, and other extras to help you learn more about the case. To be honest, though, that wasn't what made me love this book. Sure, the extras are cool and all, but I don't think they are necessary (and that's a compliment to the book, really!). CATHY'S BOOK could have stood on its own as a wonderful young adult novel.\n",

      "11 This is a good book, if you are a teen. It has a good storyline, and contrary to popular belief it is not hard to get into. The \"evidence\" in the book makes it more exiting, like you are actually helping solve the mystery, and the twist ending is a real suprise. I would recomend reading the evidence at the begging of the book and at the end but not all through it. You should enjoy the story. It is not nessecary to look at the evidence during the story, which kind of dissapointed me. I thought I would be solving the mystery, not listening to someone solve it. All in all it was a good book, but it was not everthing I expected it to be.\n",
      "12 The way the book was written is really the best thing about it. The story and the characters are interesting (although the fantasy twist did throw me off a little), but the doodles and interactive opportunities were what got me reading in the first place.\n",
      "13 nook is a good ereader and sony is also a good ereader and i would recommend both to my friends, depending on their needs/wants.\n",
      "14 I enjoyed this book because the characters were likeable and easy to relate to.  I didn't think it was a very fast read, as it took me longer than usual to read.  Last quarter of the book was a little drawn out, but overall a good read.\n",
      "15 Nothing was better than being pregnant with my son, relaxing and reading all of these wonderful novels.  This one in particular made me laugh!\n",
      "16 Standard Mommy Chick Lit...but still entertaining and quick read when you don't want to be challenged.\n",
      "17 This is a great adaptation, what is even better is what due to public domain, the download was free.  I've been a fan of the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle since I was a child.  It is startling how many of his works are the basis of some of the more common tropes in movies and novels today.  That being said these stories still feel fresh and engaging in spite of this.  I highly recommend these books, not all classics age well, but this one did in every way that matters.\n",
      "18 I'm not sure if the stories are so predictable because the \"twists\" have been mined by TV and movies for over a century or they are simply too \"elementary.\"\n",
      "19 The short story format was just what I needed. I don't have time to churn through page after page, hoping to find a good stopping point. The large print was a pleasure to read. I was able to use my regular reading glasses and not the coke bottle eyeware. Most of the stories were fascinating and nearly impossible to figure out, but I must admit that I nearly outwhitted Holmes a couple of times as situations become predictable. That is my reason for the score of four. But Holmes ability to observe the slightest nuance never failed to fascinate me, and I highly recommend the book.\n",
      "20 Great collection of short stories. Be prepared for the resolutions to be brief and somewhat anti-climactic; these are the real tales written by Doyle. A refreshing break from overly dramatized cinema, just simple narratives with charming verbiage and the vernacular of a different time. I enjoyed this read over several weeks, one at a time as relaxing bedtime reading.\n",
      "21 This is a fairly engaging classic read, and would be worth your while to download, especially as it is free. Given the mediocre (or, in some cases, even less than mediocre) free downloadables that Amazon has granted virtual publication through its site, reading this one would give your tortured minds a rest as you follow the genius of crime-solving Sherlock Holmes and his faithful companion, Dr. Watson.\n",
      "22 Being neither a reader of Canon Doyle's nor a particular fan of mystery novels, I felt it was time to delve into both.  This collection of short stories exhibited to me that the author truly has a commendable ability to tell an easily understood and very fluid tale.  His exposition is linear and does not rely on flashbacks or forward projections and his utilization of Watson through 1st person singular is unique.  While I still remain less than enamored by mystery tales, I can understand why he is a long-standing favorite of the reading public.\n",
      "23 i love all the stories, & even tho i,m 90 yrs old still enjoy them . the movies did not do justice to some of the syories\n",
      "24 Wow, I enjoyed this reading journey, partly because Mr. Horowitz always keeps me involved and thinking, but in this adventure,  I constantly wondered how he managed to keep on track with writing himself into the plot.  It fascinated me.  He did a marvelous job.  As a librarian, I spent years book talking his young adult books to my junior high students and usually successfully pushing my so reluctant boy readers toward his writing that I enjoyed reading myself.  He writes as well for so called adult readers.\n",
      "25 This was very enjoyable and I thought the characters mostly did the originals justice but I took issues with two things.\n",
      "26 I got this book not really expecting to like it, but I loved it. It has a lot twist and turns that keep guessing just like a good book should. I'm excited to read the read the read one.  And the fact that he writes for one of favorite murder mystery shows, Midsomer Murders, just makes it even better.  :)\n",
      "27 I found the stories only vaguely interesting with the characters being only vaguely developed. I’m not sure these have stood the test of time as some of the other “classics” that I have read.\n",
      "28 I found this book an excellent read. The short story format was excellent with each adventure drawing you in always wanting to read more. I found that the depth of character development was engaging and the descriptions of the scenes likewise very vivid. I have enjoyed this book so much that I am planning to read more from Arthur Conan Doyle.\n",
      "29 Watson, Holmes, Moriarty all classics characters I enjoy in this awesome classic read.  As a child I read this in chinese, and now as an adult I'm able to enjoy this in english.  A lot of details are lost when you translate a western language into an eastern language.  Thankfully now with this book, I'm able to fill in some of the missing blanks.\n",
      "30 Read these stories aloud as we traveled in the auto. Good story content, well described--without being to wordy, felt as though we were there with the character/s. My only thought is that the Kindle doesn't convert money amounts so we had to just makeup our own figures. Didn't really change the story line any. Enjoyable book to real aloud, even motivated a magazine only reading adult to pick up a book and read alone. :)\n",
      "31 What started as a spur of the moment subway distraction grew to a life long devotion. Even though I own several variations of the stories in anthologies now and belong to several Sherlockian bookclubs and scions, I still find myself rereading this version on my phone when I had time to kill or need to reference these stories.\n",
      "32 A great freebie to keep on the kindle for when you've overspent your budget and still want something to read.  You don't have to read the full book - each short mystery is self contained but you learn more about the characters as you read more of the stories.  Especially enjoyable if you have recently seen the blockbuster movie.  You will be surprised how much of the movie details are in the stories.\n",
      "33 The Entertainment value is great. The stories are timeless with very realistic yet fantastic content. It holds its own even in today's highly saturated entertainment market. Love to spend time and read these short stories.  As they say it all in the details and the characters deliver every bit in these stories without much investment in your time as a reader.\n",
      "34 The stories were good but average at best. They are obviously not much like the shows or movies as they have taken huge artistic liberties. In any case, it is free and a quick read.\n",
      "35 I am only half way through having read 6 chapters (out of 12) as of present and just have to say these are great / fun intriguing tales with Dr. Watson being the main narrative.  I have the Kindle version and so far really nice job with the character illustrations accompanying the story lines in each separate chapter a tale in itself. Really enjoyable and fun reading.\n",
      "36 Whilst a Study in Scarlet began the canon - the Adventures marked the beginning of the saga that became the most celebrated fictional character ever and deservedly so.  Full of intriguing mysteries - not all murders and some quite prosaic but true mysteries.  a pity we seem to lack mystery writers now - they rely on serial killers and not the mystery!\n",
      "37 This is a collection of short stories.  Quite entertaining, with frequent twists that keep you guessing.  Not as riveting as an original Tom Clancy novel, but quite entertaining.  Also, it is easy to set it down at the end of a short story, and begin anew.\n",
      "38 There are other reviews of this product that led me to believe that it was a normal size book for the amount of stories in it. However, it is a very thin book with extremely small print!\n",

Most of the books I've read cost about 10 dollars.  I've downloaded free books from Google e-books that would otherwise have cost a small fortune.  It's nice not to have to find a home for a book that I've read but don't want to keep.  With this product, the advantages are that it is lightweight, you can increase/change the font and size, which is a huge advantage if you have vision issues, you don't accumulate physical books that you don't want to keep, and the Glowlight at night is fantastic when you want to read when your partner is ready for lights out.
